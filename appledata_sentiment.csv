0,i got my new macbook pro m  two weeks ago and could not be more happy with it  this machine is absolutely incredible in terms of speed  looks  weight size  display  and battery life   and texture  it feels so good against the skin on my wrists as i type  and basically anything else you can think of  i also love the space gray color  the new keyboard  the touch bar  and the larger trackpad  there are so many options to customize the system to work just the way i like my previous macbook was the      model and it still works today  but after    years it became too slow and the trackpad had trouble clicking  so after a ton of research  i decided to pull the trigger and get the new macbook pro with the m  chip a couple suggestions i am able to give after spending almost two months and probably over    hours researching the new macbook are  go with the standard model of  gb of ram and the     ssd   you can get this on amazon for       vs       at apple   so you get to save    bucks  and you have the added satisfaction of not having to deal with the snobby nerd losers that work in the apple store  who asked me rudely when i went in to get a new laptop  umm  do you have an appointment  well  you re going to have to make an appointment if you want to go in the store   i love apple products and will never use another phone or computer besides the iphone and macbook  but after that experience i will never again give my business to the physical apple stores  i mean  seriously  do you really need me to make an appointment to buy a       laptop  whatever dude anyway  in several youtube videos that compared the  gb ram model along side the   gb ram model  costs     bucks more   the  gb performed just as well in nearly every task   and they really pushed it to the limits  the only reason to pay up for the   gb ram is if you want to edit  k uhd videos or are a super serious music recording artist or highly advanced professional photographer   and even then it s not too much of a difference  for the every day user  me or basically anyone who is not a computer professional  the  gb working with this new m  chip is mind blowing  blows any other laptop on the market completely out of the water  and actually even performs just as well as the          inch macbook pro using the intel chip  as far as the storage goes      ssd is standard   that s what i got   and you can pay     bucks more for     ssd or     bucks more for   tb  but with the cloud storage available now  you don t really need to keep much on the laptop drive  you can just save it to the cloud overall i honestly could go on for hours about every little detail that i absolutely love about this machine  a free one year subscription to apple tv is also another little perk  but i am still mystified every day at how incredible this machine is  i ve been online for over   hours now and its still on     battery  the new retina display is brilliant  everything is perfect  i truly am in love this laptop and would recommend that anyone looking for a new laptop to last a long time and outperform everything else on the market gets the new matchbook    inch m  ,UK,0.996,positive
1,i bought my mac from apple directly not from amazon  this thing is amazing  battery life is awesome  hard to believe that i can work with it all day and do not have to charge at all even with bright screen no issues with speed at all  i use matlab a lot and this computer is even slightly faster than my desktop with    core amd cpu and    gb ram excellent machine  happy i bought it ,UK,0.944,positive
2,i own over    computers and it blows away my   th gen dell xps    i   my surface book    my ryzen   thinkpad  the first week i got it the battery lasted for   days and    hrs of use and still had     left  i felt guilty and charged it  the geekbench   rating beat all those listed laptops and they had    or   gb of memory and the macbook pro m  had only  gb of unified memory  the keyboard felt great  the sound was superb  the screen bright  and it was blazing fast in all i did  i m an it consultant and deal in windows based databases and this mac has now become my daily go to system at home  it has become my new front end ,UK,0.8779,positive

4,dead at arrival     kernel error  took it to the apple store they told me looks like a hardware failure and to send it back to amazon ,UK,-0.7964,negative
5,i m going to preface this review with the   thing i dislike so we can get that out of the way i mean let s be honest  that s what most people are looking for when buying a product the down sides it has a standard    mm headphone jack even though apple quit using that on it s handheld products years ago not that i care  it s good that they include the    mm jack but how come they didn t include one for their lightning connector that their headphones come in out of the box  forces you to either change to a standard headphone jack or bt headphones  probably trying to push their airpods line  other than that  i have no issues  it s fast  efficient  reliable and easy to use  if your familiar with ios on these then it ll be a great addition to the tech team you have at home ,UK,0.9167,positive
6,i love my new macbook pro    it s the     and not too small  it s very lightweight   it s so fast   i was using an older macbook pro from mid       it worked well  just so slow  this one flies    i was disappointed that there are no usb ports or cd player  i spent about     at best buy and got an adapter that works very well   ,UK,0.8074,positive
7,the battery lasts forever and its fast  my last macbook had a pretty good battery and worked very well for years too the m  does allow for dual external monitors and there are two usbc ports total  these two things can be worked around with dongles and a video hub but now i have      worth of accessories and a tangled mess on my desk how is a      mac not compatible with dual monitors but my      hp works great with the same monitor setup    i really can t get past that get the intel version with   usb ports and you can use it in your covid home office out of the box ,UK,0.8734,positive
8,there is no fix for this  and now it can t be returned   all that money wasted    there is a vertical black line on the screen   i tried to fix it using tips from youtube videos and none of it worked   proceed with caution ,UK,-0.6597,negative
9,i really wanted to love this laptop  i ve had only macs for years  this was supposed to be an upgrade from my      macbook air  i previously had a          intel based macbook pro for work configured with two hp monitors  no issues with the monitors and connected instantly with zero effort to get the screens to work with the laptop  bought this one and connected to my belkin hub for the hdmis  would only connect a single monitor  googled the issue and found that the new m  apple chip only supports a single monitor  news to me and i guess i should have researched more  however the low rating stems from the fact that this is a pro laptop  a professional would want two monitors and should not have to google whether a pro laptop supports more than   monitor when the intel version does seamlessly  despite this i had planned to keep it and just deal with   monitor because of the cost savings over buying the intel based macbook pro and wanted the longer battery life  now brings me to the issue that made me return the laptop  this laptop just would not configure to show a clear resolution with my monitors  the scale was off and the display just stayed blurry no matter what setting i changed it to on the monitor or the laptop s settings  tried and tried and just gave up  returned this and ordered an intel based     macbook pro  no issues  supports dual monitors  and seamlessly integrated to the laptop  no blurry screen and no having to set or change any settings to get it to work  i am floored that apple would produce a pro for business that only supports a single monitor  i love apple but will not buy anything with their chip until the kinks are worked out ,UK,0.6577,positive
10,i am an apple guy  i converted from pc        and have loved every apple device until the iphone x and the new macbook with m  chip  where to start  first  as is a major complaint for everyone  the macbook pro has all of two ports  yes yes  i know  this was listed in the specs  it doesn t make it ok   if i need to be plugged in  i have   port remaining  it is incredibly idiotic that i have to buy a dock to expand my ports  oh and the ports are only thunderbolt in apple s continuing stupidity of forcing the market to adopt its garbage  i did not buy a mac air for a reason  yet the macbook pro comes with all the limitations of an air  the new charging cable lacking magnetic attachment makes zero sense  the track pad is beyond finicky to the point of being useless  i have no bluetooth connectivity  i get incessant windows telling me to log into podcasts or apple music  i see zero performance improvements with the m chip  in fact  doing a side by side video recording with quicktime  all parameters equalized  i have a severe lag with m  mac  but not with the intel driven machine  and the touch bar is about the worst idea ever  i constantly dim the back light  or go back on web pages because of it  absolute trash  i bought this computer for work and will be designating it as a laptop for our interns  because that s how terrible it is  i will not be duped into replacing this hunk of garbage with the forthcoming macbook pro in which the port and charging issues have been fixed so now begins the massive switching costs for foolishly demonstrating brand loyalty to a company who has none for its customers ,UK,-0.7749,negative
11,update        a few updates now have made the pinwheel subside quite a bit  hope that future updates will make it go away for good previous i constantly get the pinwheel when switching between programs i e  explorer  outlook  teams  amazon music  notes  etc  these are not high power requirement applications  it is especially bad when docking and undocking from my workstation   i have my previous macbook pro setup exactly like this model and it powers through without issues  the problem has gotten so bad that i have momentarily switched back to my previous one until apple gets the software figured out with some updates  disappointing ,UK,-0.0643,negative
12,i can t even believe that i am writing this review  but this is unprecedented  after just one week of using it  i want to get rid of it  this laptop is slower than my      macbook pro    inc  all this hype about the m  chip  and when i open    tabs on google chrome  it s game over  the laptop starts lagging  the sound cuts  i can t even move the mouse and of course  my favorite spinning apple colored wheel is spinning forever trying to load  my cpu is at a      this is not what you would expect from the latest apple models  and this is out of the box laptop,UK,0.0,negative
13,so i got this item which was not working and had the camera going crazy with green lines all around  i asked amazon  for getting a working laptop for my interview and they said we dont replace items that are electronics which is weird since my friend faced similar issue and he got a working laptop  and due to all this i had to re schedule my interview and the company said we will be moving on with other candidates this time thank you amazon,UK,0.6124,positive
14,had windows based computers since day one  always something going on with them  i ve had at least    windows computers and decided it was time to try an apple  well i got to say i love this computer  a little bit of a learning curve but not a stumbling block  don t let the     fool you  it s an awesome screen size and so sharp  i would recommend this computer to anyone ,UK,0.9136,positive
15,the media could not be loaded                          i was not disappointed as this was my first time buying a computer on amazon  and here is why the ordering experience was much easier than my last visit to an apple store to purchase a computer   the computer arrived in two days  on time  a gift to our son who is heading to college this space grey laptop is the perfect size and weight when on campus  it includes an audio jack and two thunderbolt   usb   ports the package also includes a charger with a cord and a straightforward setup i like the fantastic apple design of this laptop with the space grey casing   i m glad overall that this laptop will last up to    hours on a charge  has a great screen  and is more than the required memory and speed as requested by the university  simply perfect and well worth it   therefore i rate this product five out of five stars ,UK,0.9861,positive
16,i don t normally write reviews  but since i spent       on this macbook pro m      from amazon i have been very pleased  i have had it for less than a month and so far everything seems to be in perfect working order  i really love it to be honest  i was skeptical and a bit anxious about buying from amazon instead of apple directly  but i can say that there is no difference and it seems i got it      cheaper on amazon and   day shipping  just make sure it s sold and fulfilled by amazon  all in all very pleased  for anyone on the fence about it you shouldn t be  screen is bright  speakers are amazing  keyboard feels very nice  and battery is great ,UK,0.9948,positive
17,coming from years and years of pc  i must say that this     m  macbook pro is an internet beast  i also use it for lightroom  photoshop  affinity suite  capture one  fl studio and i have zero complaints  i hadn t had a mac since the mid    s and i was a huge fan then  but pc s just offer so much more for the money the ports are an issue and you will need to buy a dock like device because you ll need it to hookup older devices or more than two devices at some point get the   gb model   while i have no issues with ram so far  i believe the   gb model should be the base model because the hibernation sleep is going to kill the nand hard drive eventually from writing to disk every time you close the lid there is an issue with the keyboard that i haven t been able to replicate  but the delete key will enter a state where it doesn t work  though the keyboard still functions  i have to close whatever window i m typing in in order to get the delete key working again  it s not random  but i haven t figured out what two key combo is causing the problem or if it s just in twitter the screen is      accurate  close enough  out of the box   the reason i got the macbook pro is because of the issues i was having with my     dell xps  which is a beast  color discrepancy when exporting  the colors were always over saturated and i had to guess what settings to use to counter the output  i did everything imaginable and always color calibrate with spyder  for    years i ve done this  but the accuracy was never the same on other screens  printing or web postings i never used the touch screen on the xps  i hate smudged screens the battery life is insane  as you ve probably heard    days  all day  no issues surfing the web at whatever levels are auto adjusted for on battery usage the touchpad   while really good  there are times when the two finger scrolling skips around  but overall  is a good experience i m not a fan of the operating system at all  just like ios  it s just too clunky and cluttered  something odd coming from a company who builds incredible hardware with fantastic esthetic designs ,UK,-0.6674,negative
18,for many people this will be a great and fast notebook  if you connect devices you need to know the ports are fast but can not supply very much power  if you have software on cd dvd  be aware that your bus powered dvd drive probably will not work  same if you attach external storage that needs more power than a newer ssd  to fix this you need a hub   dock that is externally powered and supplies power to any device plugged into the hub ,UK,0.3716,positive
19,i finally  after years of my artist friends and colleagues using apple product  laptops  macbooks  desktops  i decided i d get one as i needed a new laptop since my previous one was    years old  at first  i was just sad for having spent so much  i thought  this better convince me otherwise   after having this for two months  i can say i hate it don t get me wrong  there s some decent features that add convenience  but i struggle to complete work in a timely manner as i have to constantly save or redo lost work  the macbook can t consistently run  for example  adobe indesign  adobe illustrator  and one google page  i know you re probably thinking  maybe her file size of the projects she s working on are bogging down a successful running speed and responsiveness   that is not the case the work i am creating at this moment in time is basic web design  typographic studies of minor levels of file work  and an occasional image that needs photoshopped all in all  this product is a bit expensive for my liking  it s got many decent aspects  such as a finger id to unlock easily and touchscreen bar along the top of the keyboard display  cool  but not worth         after tax  if it is going to prohibit my work in graphic design ,UK,0.9476,positive
20,it s a macbook pro bro  what s there not to like  it s been  yrs since my      macbook pro purchase and i still use it  i just have to keep it plugged in because i can t find a good battery replacement for it  this m  is much thinner    i would say half as thin as the    retina model battery life seems good but it was good on my last one  i can use it all day  button press trackpad even the touchbar is good  i do not understand the complaints about the touchbar  i find it kinda cool and ok  maybe my opinion will change after some use the speed is what everyone raves about  i don t see it  it may be slightly faster but it s hard to tell just how much faster  when i open or load it doesn t seem super fast as everyone claims  i m sure it s faster but it s not like its drastically noticeable i had one issue initially  i set up my fingerprint id and all was fine until one day it didn t work and it asked me for my password  i could not remember my password and it took a whole day to figure out how to reset it  so far it s only happened once and i hope it doesn t happen again because using the fingerprint scanner i forgot my password already  the audio is good  definitely not tinny or hollow its that good quality audio you expect  good full sound  volume is ok too could maybe be a little louder i do not like that it has no ports  just   usb c slots    you will have to buy an adapter  at least they kept the headphone jack  i also do not like clicking to drag n drop  i don t see any settings that i can change for this  i like being able to tap and   finger drag i was expecting this to be really fast because that s what they were bragging about but for the money i maybe should have got the air with more gb  but the camera and sound is better on this one  the screen doesn t look as hd as the retina model seems a little flat but it s good  overall you know the quality of apple  i will most likely always have a macbook pro    ,UK,0.9899,positive
21,there are too many baffling oddball problems    like it won t do portrait mode on a displaylink monitor   it has problems with docking stations that ought to work just fine    despite me turning off sleep and screen locking  when in clamshell closed mode  sometimes it won t wake up and has to be hard power cycled or zapped to get it to boot back up   these issues are virtually nonexistent on intel silicon of the same era os revision level   the problems with external monitors feel like they re reintroducing problems most vendors  including apple  fixed over a decade ago i m completely soured on m   and have no interest in m x   i may trade this in for a mini   it s all but useless as portable computer because docking undocking causes such nightmarish problems m  maybe  once it s been out for a year or two   yes  i know that this is the risk of being an early adopter   i m still going to call out its flaws even though i know i am the author of my own suffering here also  again not an apple problem but a me problem   i hate the touch bar and leave it completely disabled   i m clumsy and have big fingers ,UK,-0.8582,negative
22,i am a long time windows user  i ve had so many different windows laptops  each with their own faults  i ve always despised macbooks because of what you hear from every person who s built a pc before   apple makes crappy products    no good to use       ever since i got my ipad pro a few years back  apple has slowly dragged me back into the ecosystem by how good their products have become  with the release of the m  macs  i was pretty interested in how well these will perform  and eventually caved and bought this macbook pro i was wrong  i ve been wrong  this macbook pro has very good performance and has kicked ass through everything i throw at it  i like the big sur operating system  everything has been made super easy  and also connects to all of my other apple devices  being able to to text people from my macbook is awesome  my only complaint is honestly  like everyone else  the touch bar  i wish i had the regular function keys like on the air  i got this one because of better battery life  and man  this laptop lasts me a week  what     my ol reliable acer laptop only lasted me   hours  and i thought that was good sorry windows fanboys  sorry pc master race  for laptops  i will never replace my home windows desktop   the macbook is one of the best devices you can buy  it s great ,UK,0.9828,positive

24,my laptop lasted less than   months before it died  i talked to an amazon rep who was responsive and put me in touch with an apple rep  who was curt  he suggested bringing it to a local shop licensed by apple to diagnose and repair  but he said they didn t have an appointment for almost a week  at the shop  they were much more responsive but warned that a small crack in the bottom of the screen that happened when i close it one day likely caused the problem  would not be covered by the warranty and would cost      to fix   fingers crossed it is something else  but he said he was    percent sure this would be the case   two issues with my      apple macbook pro with apple m  chip     inch   gb ram     gb ssd storage      debris can fall into the seam between the keyboard and screen unseen and    i kept having to adjust the brightness  even though i set the screen to be bright  it kept returning to dim  my other complaint is that the apple rep was curt  the tech at the shop said he sees a lot of screen issues and highly recommended by the warranty plus plan  which costs over       for two years  i think  and then      year ,UK,0.7575,positive
25,i left my brand new m  macbook pro in my car for an hour and now the screen looks like a picasso painting   both amazon and apple refuse to pay for repairs because apparently this is considered an accident rather than a manufacturer s defect  even though i bought it only two months ago   so i m out      to repair a two month old computer   i would heavily advise against buying one of these  because if this is considered normal rather than a manufacturer s defect  then    degree heat is enough to damage the screen   this means that they re essentially useless if your air conditioner goes out and you will be left with a repair bill that is half the value of the computer ,UK,-0.872,negative
26,this is a m  model   it is fast  it is light  it is powerful  it wakes up in seconds      it saves me time like crazy  no longer the annoying ball       it replaces my old and faithful macbook pro late       yes          everything works from the beginning      in my older mac  which i still keep just in case  i could still run everything i needed  but it was definitely much slower   the new one is great   take the op to say kudos to apple  until    days ago i was still using a   years old computer  running big sur and every single app i needed and the only change  has been one of speed  great change by the way    all is compatible  i just put in a caldigit dock and do not need to buy anything else new        well done ,UK,0.9782,positive
27,i am extremely disappointed with this machine  i bought this specifically because it had a gpu  which i thought would be beneficial for programming with data  however  the new apple chip is completely unworkable  none of the modern software packages for data science are compatible with the chip  rendering the machine worthless and void for its intended purpose  i will never purchase another apple machine ,UK,-0.5256,negative
28,the media could not be loaded                          on the right hand side you can see a black line of dead pixels that quickly became much worse  and although it was on every window you can really see it on the graph where the image burned into the   week old screen that i barely used and bought specifically because it was considered the best option for trading view the program in the video  you can see  facebook logo burnt in on the right but the whole screen was ghosting everything bad   it s just hard to see most of it  i have no idea what caused this  as it s not a    year old crt display with an nes left on for years  it s a brand new liquid retina i m sure i m not the only one to experience this but do keep in mind i was lucky and able to return because this happened one day before my    day window closed  my experience with apple has always been with second market items aside from my phone they are not very helpful unless you pay  a very high service fee  i m sure i could have had this repaired for free but at the price and the fact that it was my very first mac i sent it back and have no intention on owning another one  best thing i could suggest is if you must own a mack buy apple care they will replace  it twice brand new  u may need that done  the build quality outside of the electronics is unmatched  absolute perfection in every seam  i wish it would have worked i bolutely loved this machine until the day it broke down  now i won t ever feel comfortable owning a new one again  i did purchase the m  ipad instead and love it  well my  tb model  the     is not enough storage  tb i m sure will be plenty  i think apple is a great product as long u never have any issues  if you do be ready to spend like you did the day you made your purchase ,UK,0.9951,positive

31,i ve been an apple user for over    years  and i was pretty excited to make the m  migration now that many apps have been updated for apple silicon  i expected to be blown away  and while this is an excellent apple laptop  and the battery life does live up to the hype  i overall i found it disappointing compared to the reviews  three things    sure  it may fly if you re doing really cpu heavy things  but for things like  heavy  productivity  i found it no better than my intel      in fact       this could be related to all the stories i read saying    gb on apple silicon is like   gb on intel    yeah  don t believe those  again  this may be true for tasks that are well suited for arm  but heavy productivity work is no better  i keep a decent but not insane amount of safari tabs open at any time  and that plus having much of anything else open kept the memory pressure graph constantly in the yellow  if not red  and that may or may not be related to the biggest problem which is       i had significant problems using my lg  k display which has worked like a champ with my      sometimes it would take up to   minutes before things  settled down  and i was actually able to use the computer again  that was a dealbreaker would   and   have been better with more memory  or are these m  growing pains  or something else  i don t know  i ll probably give the     a try with   gb whenever it comes out  for now  this     was just too underpowered for my fairly average professional needs i realize that reviews below   stars on this are rare  which i find puzzling for the reasons above  hope this is helpful to anyone who might be wondering about the downsides ,UK,0.9848,positive
32,i got this for        which it s       if you buy it from apple  which makes no sense   it was either this or the macbook air for       which is      at apple    i got this because i ve had many macbook airs and wanted something different   if i had to do it again  and wanted to save money i would have gotten the air   the difference is this has a fan  a touch bar  a better gpu  and a brighter screen for      more   i was worried because some people don t like the touch bar but i think it s great   and besides  you can even set the touch bar up so it s just like the old function keys you re used to  but as touch keys there really is no competition for a macbook   i ve tried them all  the dells  the surfacebooks  etc  and they re never as good as an apple macbook ,UK,0.8361,positive
33,i was excited to get the new macbook pro m  as reviews described it as a very fast powerhouse computer  my first impression was strong  i started to play with all the features my old macbook pro is missing  i was excited about extending the screen to my ipad pro will be able to paint in photoshop  with sidecar   this feature is completely underwhelming and unpractical to use  mostly due to how interface of this feature is set up   the next feature i was excited to try was installing ipad iphone app to macbook pro    well  this works here and there  applications are crashing    again very underwhelming  three weeks later my new macbook pro started having issues when plugging into the power source through thunderbolt  after i unplug it from power  the second time when plugin it wouldn t charge  i had to unplug the thunderbolt cable both from the power adapter and from a computer and plug it back to the charger first then to the computer in order for mac to charge again  i ran self diagnostic on startup and it would freeze  luckily i was still in the amazon window to return this now broken computer  i don t understand how apple machines became so unreliable  now i m hesitant to order another apple computer as this is the very first new computer i ever purchased turns out to be a lemon ,UK,0.9107,positive

35,i bought this laptop primarily for college  as someone who has dealt with both devils by the name of apple and microsoft  the operating system differences don t bother me  although  one thing i did find is that when i go home and i m not able to do any gaming  it can be a bit of an irritation  but that was never why i bought this laptop to begin with   the screen and battery life on this thing are amazing  my previous laptops had terrible screens and had a max battery life of about two hours  this laptop  between using it for school  doing photo editing  graphic design  coding  and video editing  can easily last me up to two days or even more  the one thing i will say is that frequently in order for me see things most of the time  i need the screen cranked up past     brightness most of the time  i like the touch bar  i barely use function keys in most applications and the apps that do use them have the buttons on the touch bar anyways  i will say though unless you care about the touch bar  a slightly larger battery  and a fan being inside this machine  which for the record  with all of my use of heavy exports and edits  has never once turned on   just buy the macbook air  for school especially  it will get you across fine  the   gb model is also superb in most of the tasks i need to accomplish  i mean  it has similar performance in what i need for compared to my pc with a ryzen     x  and rtx       and   gb of ram  there were a couple of times where webpages tried to use more than  gb of ram and that caused some trouble  but after turning on an ad blocker i never had that issue again  macos has superb memory management  which allows for someone semi professional like me to get by with it just fine ,UK,0.9872,positive
36,i love my macbook pro  i had the    inch macbook air      and i hated that thing  used it for college and i wanted to get rid of it so bad so i gave it away  i always wanted the macbook pro because i thought they were just built better and i the interface of how its designed looked way better  finally was able to buy one and so far so good  i really hope and pray this one doesn t start going slow like how my macbook air did after a year or    bought one for my friend as well and she loves hers  i mainly use it for work  school zoom calls and a little bit of streaming  not a gamer so battery life is something i never have to worry about  battery life was amazing for the first   weeks but  i can tell now the battery has been dying slightly faster but i believe it s from how much i ve been on it lately but if i put it down for a few days  most likely    battery life hangs in there ,UK,0.9267,positive
37,hyper portability  ridiculously speed and responsiveness  and a very robust battery are some of the highlights of this little mac  it s up and running from sleep as fast as a smartphone wakes  the trackpad   gestures make me forget i don t actually have a touchscreen here  and the m  manages battery draw like nothing i ve ever seen in a laptop the touch bar is controversial  but i love it  it s a great premium feature  but not necessarily a great  pro  feature  replacing the f  line of keys with a touch screen that changes function based on what app you re using is actually pretty great and it ties in well with the idea of gestures via the trackpad as a method of interacting with the computer if you ve never tried a mac before  i highly recommend starting here ,UK,0.9894,positive

41,pros  very sleek product  battery life is amazing  fast boot up and general processing speeds cons  hardware soldered to main board preventing or drastically reducing easy hardware upgradesi was stoked to get the laptop at the price point until i discovered what i listed in the con area  now i m stuck with  gb of memory and a    gb ssd    years ago this wouldn t have been a big deal  obviously i could expand storage by using an external source of some sort and tune memory to swap more using virtual disk  but who wants to do that when the original intent was to upgrade the memory and drive after brief use  for lite and everyday computing  this will be more than adequate  for gaming  development  or running virtual platforms do not buy due to the ridiculous effort it will take to upgrade  i m thinking of giving this to my wife in exchange for her      macbook pro that i ve already doubled the memory and drive capacity on with great ease  apple needs to rethink this garbage new era engineering  yes  direct solder makes things run faster to a point  but the trade of losing upgrade capability is not worth it  buyer beware ,UK,0.94,positive

46,i love my mbp  as a windows user since the early    s  i ve gone through all sorts of computer systems  desktops and laptops  name brand pre built systems and custom builds and i ve got to say  apple knows how to construct an absolutely gorgeous and solid device with premium build quality  my interest in windows began waning after windows   and has been a downward spiral since  in terms of user experience  maintenance  bugs  endless updates  updates for those updates  etc  i was not going to stick around for another lackluster release with windows    on the way  which my fairly new and high end laptop at the time didn t even officially qualify for the upgrade   the learning curve was not too steep and has been more rewarding in the past several weeks of use  i forget how much of a pleasure it was to use a computer that the developers actually understand the needs of the customer base  i am equally amazed by just how seamlessly everything just seems to work  i used to think in terms of apple monopolizing the market by offering a product that they built both on the hardware and software side  but that is in part why it just works so flawlessly ,UK,0.9303,positive
47,good macbook  i owned a      prior to this and vowed to get macbooks for their superior performance i rated this a   because i had some eye strain which was of great irritance  however i just turned off the true colors and changed the background to a softer color  problem solved i also didn t appreciate that now it uses a usb c type dock  so now i have to get new adapters and wires to connect it s thunderbolt   to other devices    it took me a good three weeks to figure everything out despite this i love the sound and picture quality  the touch bar is cool too    update after   months of usei can t handle the heavy eye fatigue caused from this new macbook  to be honest  i think my vision got worst after using this mac   i m a teacher  so i must look at my screen a lot   comparing it to another macbook that i owned  a macbook pro      which i got replaced with this m    i got very little eye fatigue from it   also the design doesn t work if you add a case to it   a case would prevent you to effectively use the usb c ports as the bottom part of a case would interfere with it ,UK,0.9397,positive

56,i ve had the new m  macbook pro for several months now  and i have to say that it lives up to all of the superlative reviews it received  as expected  the most noticeable improvement is its speed  which is in another league from my      mac  battery life is excellent  and the automatic day night screen change works very well  although some prefer the standard control bar on the macbook air  i think the automatic control bar on the new pro is really neat  i also like the larger touch pad on the pro vs the one on the air  all things considered  the new macbook pro is a great value  especially at the amazon sale price ,UK,0.9716,positive

435,macs use to be quite a great computer  however  this computer tends to crash with certain programs  adobe and blender   no ports for sd cards  or usb   i bought numerous external ports  spent at least     on numerous devices  and still i am always forgetting them  i would at least love this feature to come back and or will to pay extra for this feature   this is probably fine for most users but for anyone working with arts  graphics and using different programs etc  this is a real inconvenience  mac has continued to make its products less compatible with other computer brands   overall this will be my last macbook  the drop and drag  and numerous features that made this a great computer and easy to use  were awesome but are no longer worth it  oh yeah  also i lost numerous movies that i had purchased off of my itunes  i contacted the itunes customer service and no help   pretty much i am sad  and frustrated and constantly trying to bend around apples new rules  like not only needing memory space on the computer  which mine is not full  but my icloud is full  after only   or   months of use and they want me to pay a monthly fee to save projects even on my desktop   so i watched a youtube video to remove icloud saving features because its pointless  and took numerous of my projects in progress and changed them  so now i changed it back and it rearranged my whole desktop order and i can not save any video files on this computer or any other project on my desktop  apple has been a throne inside and i caution those who are working on arts  coding etc  to save the stress and frustration and stray away  this computer is pretty much an ipad for people that don t want ipads   ,UK,0.9803,positive
436,let me start off the apple ecosystem is great but what really disappointed me after   months of use the screen starting getting bright spots along the bottom and left side and eventually turned into a mess of different colors rendering that part useless  i got a quote from apple for     dollars to fix the screen including parts and labor and a   month wait time  i also had major connectivity issues with usb products using apples adapter too  it seems as if apples quality has gone down hill lately and this has pushed me away from apple  this will be my last apple product i purchase sadly,UK,-0.8702,negative
437,first off  let me say  i m speaking as a tech enthusiast with a decent understanding of gizmos and gadgets  i ve owned windows pcs  a macbook pro       and a few chromebooks  this is  by far  my favorite computer that i ve ever used  period  let me start with my favorite aspects features  in lovely bullet points for your viewing pleasure  battery life  oh my god  i have to try to kill this thing in one day  full brightness  playing the sims   or world of warcraft  spotify playing  safari and chrome open in the background    i went from about      to     in an hour  and that s the most i could do  usually  i start the day at full battery  then use it on and off all day  and the lowest i ve gotten so far is      by bedtime  it  is  insane  not to mention the standby  which is basically      drop in a day  i cannot stress how amazed i am by the efficiency of this machine  speakers  okay  i know some people don t mind a tinny little laptop speaker because they use headphones  but i am not that person  i like to be able to just play music or videos out loud and enjoy them  well  these speakers are also the best i ve ever heard on a laptop  it s got such a full  defined  crisp sound  i can hear a lot more of the dynamic range and background effects than any other laptop i ve used  it also gets loud  i can use it to fill my room with sound  and in fact i ve had to turn it down a bit at night because my roomies down the hall can hear it  the bass is the only point that isn t a home run  but for what it s worth  i can definitely hear the bass  it just doesn t boom  overall  amaaaazing  keyboard  short and sweet  this is my favorite keyboard  the previous spot was my      macbook pro  but this surpasses that  the keys travel well  i make less mistakes  and it s quiet and comfortable  not much else to say  it s just really good  screen  still a gorgeous retina display  crisp  bright af  colorful  and easy on the eyes thanks to true tone  i m not an artist or video editor  so this is just coming from an average consumer  touch bar  i know this is a divisive opinion  but i personally really like the touch bar  some apps take advantage of it  and it really helps  spotify keeps the controls on the bar  so i can switch and adjust music without having to switch back to the app  the sliders for brightness and volume are easy to press and slide  and frankly i just enjoy it  touch id on the corner is also lovely for logging in  making purchases  or filling forms out on webpages  one touch and you re good  brilliant  form factor  i love this skinny slab of aluminum  i m a minimalist  and it just pleases me to hold and look at  this is completely subjective  but i m a fan  speed  oh my god  this thing is legitimately the fastest computer that i ve ever used  i m honestly shook at how easily it handles anything i throw at it  it runs world of warcraft on high settings at   fps  no other macbook could do that  the   core graphics chip really lives up to its specs  i can have tons of tabs open  a game  things updating in the background  and this guy doesn t break a sweat  all while absolutely sipping battery  fans  yes  the main difference between this and the m  air is that the pro has an active cooling system  that being said  i ve heard the fan come on about   times in   weeks  even when running all that stuff i said before  i m befuddled by how great the thermal dissipation works in this thing  it s good that it has fans  even if it barely uses them less good but still aight  usb c ports  yes  there s only   on the left side  yes  i had to buy an adapter for hdmi and usb a  am i mad about it  not really  i only need to use those things when i m docked at a desk anyway  i use a bluetooth mouse or the touchpad  and i have airpods for headphones  so i don t need to plug many things in anyway  but if you do  definitely invest in an adapter  i use one by anker  with   usb a  an hdmi  and an ethernet port  to add to the usb c impressions  i still miss magsafe  so i actually purchased a  magnetic  usb c cable  which you put the receiver in the macbook usb port  and the cable magnetically attaches to it  just like the old magsafe  this makes me feel safer  because a firm usb c cable sticking out the side makes me nervous  if i were to drop it or hit it on something and mess up the port  highly recommend a cable like this  price  it s expensive  there s no way around that  but i d consider it an investment  because generally speaking  macs last many many years over their windows counterparts  and since this is the first to use apple silicon  i m sure it will be supported for a long while  webcam  it s just not great  the ai enhancements are definitely noticeable and make you look better  but at the end of the day  its a    p webcam in a        computer  come on apple  is     p that hard to add  app compatibility  while i have had almost no issues  some apps may not play nice with the m  right now  the only real issues i had were that the sims   deluxe collection does not work  which i discovered is an issue for everyone with the m  macs  but luckily the devs say theyre working on a fix  so hopefully it s just a small number of apps with issues  other than that  every other app has worked great verdict  i love this computer  sometimes i just sit and marvel at it  sometimes i pick it up just to feel how nice it fits in my hands  it is legitimately my favorite computer  and if you re willing to make the investment  i think it s a fantastic computer for most people  if you don t need the touch bar or extra oomph from the fans  the m  air might be for you  but for me  man  the m  macbook pro is the laptop king  or queen    stars from me update  i ve had the mbp for about   months now  and i m still completely in love with it  i stream on twitch  and i can run obs  a game like world of warcraft  spotify  discord  safari    all without a hiccup  the only real time i get the fans running is when i do this  i have seen the temperature of the cores spike to about     degrees fahrenheit under load  but it s never shut down  it throttled once  as i noticed a slowdown  but i was running literally all those apps plus a discord video call  so i assume either the  gb of ram couldn t handle it  or the cores got too hot  i was really pushing it though  battery is still amazing  and i can run wow classic on max settings easily  overall  still impressed  and still my favorite machine ever ,UK,0.9997,positive
438,on a positive note  keyboard problem has been solved  but new annoyances have been introduced  i m back to transferring pictures by wire  airdrop is too hit and miss  works  but barely  internet search for solutions shows me i am not alone  i ve been on for three hours now  charging  and i ve gone from     to     sluggish connectivity with bluetooth and internet compared to my macbook air of       sitting next to one another on the same wifi network  all kinds of little annoyances also with that bar on top  it is useless  but for sound you have to use it and it is more cumbersome than the simple old way  overheats once a day  i wish i had not bought it  the screen quality is great and i have a tb of memory  but as far as speed and ease is concerned  this thing is a trip back in time  back to steve balmer s microsoft and its contempt for consumers ,UK,-0.4479,negative

441,i am still waiting on delivery of my     macbook pro but have been running with an m  mac mini  same processor   so far i am blown away  but not surprised  by the performance  for software development workloads the m  is    x faster than my      core i      macbook pro  a compile that takes   m on the mbp takes    on the m  mac  performance benchmarks with open mpi are roughly    x better for both latency and bandwidth  and this is before any additional optimization work for gaming i tested the m  with a native build of world of warcraft  the game was playable      fps  at ultra  level     outputting     p on a     display  the fans do spin up but you never hear them  the     macbook pro has a amd radeon     and struggles to be playable at level   on the internal display  the macbook pro also gets incredibly hot tried a couple of older x   windows games  portal   and   from steam  with crossover    and they were playable at high graphics  very impressive given these are running under rosetta   ,UK,0.8356,positive
442,i bought this laptop in late january  by may  the display was suddenly filled with random lines and blocks  the genius bar assistant ran a test  found the laptop had no scratches  and promised that only the top case and display would be changed  despite my skepticism about the quality behind the macbook pro m  that only lasted   months of usage  i accepted the repair  one week later  i went back to the apple store and casually checked the repaired laptop s case  there were scratches around the top case logo  there was a dent on the bottom case edge  after i brought up these issue  the genius bar assistant became nervous and tried to run a diagnosis test  he couldn t because one of the usb c port was broken  after checking the only other usb c port  the battery was entirely drained and failed the diagnosis test  the cost of the applecare repair was quoted       but the damages it caused was probably close to       if not more  i bought a brand new       macbook pro that in a few months  had turned into a beaten  refurbished product through applecare ,UK,-0.89,negative
443,as a reference  i ve used pc s since the    s  northstar   ibm pc products since the early    s  and mac products since the early    s   i have used the computer as a consumer  a software developer  and an electrical engineer reviewed product      mpb m  chip  mb ram i ve had four mbps since      between home and work apple mac started as a great computing platform  but it has become progressively worse apple is losing their grip problems with this pc     fewer ports   this one has only two  which considering one is for charging  this actually has only one usable port   there is no port on the right side of the computer  save an obsolute analog audio port that nearly nobody uses any more    reliability   this mac continuously locks up and requires reboots the only good feature of this mac is that the keyboard works  which was not a usable feature in the prior mac generation   funny how fixing something that was clearly wrong in a prior generation is seen as an improvement i have not run any different software on this than any of the others  so it is frustrating to see apple move in the wrong direction i m quickly losing faith in the mac platform on the positive side  battery life is awesome   i would trade that for the other features that apple lost the recipe for  like reliability and a usable set of ports ,UK,0.8318,positive
444,apple reached its peak in laptop design in      with the     macbook pro with function keys   it was sleek  slim and powerful   it was beautifully designed inside and out   and with its intel processor  it could also run windows the next version introduced the ugly  tacky  useless touch bar   this turned the beautifully designed      macbook pro into something that looked like one of dell s best effort   it was definitely a step backwards and very un apple like things got interesting when apple threw in the m  chip   though it lost the ability to run windows  its vast performance increase made up for that   unfortunately  the touch bar remained so i held off on upgrading until the     came out and when the     model appeared  it was a disappointment   though with great pleasure the touch bar was ditched  in its place was an ugly notch we see in the current iphones   moreover  the case was slightly thicker and more reminiscent of the aluminum powerbooks of the late     s   this was another step backwards   plus its starting price was a whopping       so i decided i on this model  the          macbook pro  and felt i could live with the touch bar more than the notch   and after   months of use  everything i thought about the touch bar still holds true   it s ugly and useless   i found its constantly blinking display distracting so i made it static  basically turning it into virtual function keys but the main reason for the upgrade was for the m  chip   and this didn t disappoint   the new chip is very speedy  particularly when editing in final cut pro   it handles multi camera hd projects with ease  where my      machine struggled at times   and battery life is longer and the machine in general runs cooler a drawback to the m  chip is many old school apps will not work anymore   so you ll have to spend some time and money looking for equivalent apps despite the ugly touch bar  i recommend this machine over the new     model   it has the m  chip  a display without an ugly notch  and a slimmer body   it s fast enough for most users and it s hundreds of dollars less ,UK,-0.6542,negative
445,owned a      macbook air that had display issues from the get go  but apple said it might be okay if i was super careful handling it   i couldn t go without a laptop for   weeks so decided to risk it   after a couple yrs of being super careful the display became distorted after just a slight bump  and after the warranty period of course   used it hooked up to the tv only for about a year  but as that was difficult in itself  overheating  prevented sleep function  etc   had to change course   didn t wanna pay      for a new display  so   bought the m       macbook air instead  seemed to be operating well until   months in  when i wasn t even anywhere near it and the display went totally out   wouldn t turn on after repeated powering down so called apple   they had me power on with that shift control for    secs and it went on again  however  considering my experience with my last laptop took no chances and brought it in to apple they ran diagnostics and found that the ambient light sensor wasn t working   that s what automatically dims and brightens the screen when going into dark or bright places  in case you  like i  didn t really know what it did   had never dropped this or mishandled it in any way sent in my laptop for repair and it s now been more than a week without and they re still  diagnosing  it   luckily my old laptop is still semi functional if i hook it up to my tv   and i still had a few months left in the warranty   but what if it didn t and i didn t have the old one still functional two times in a row macbook air with serious display issues in the last   yrs  with no accidental damage from me  aside from this  has superior speed and processing power  doesn t overheat  but still takes       sec to power up and the touchpad functionality and the feel of both it and the keyboard are terrible when compared to the      i used to have if you buy an apple laptop now apple care plus is almost mandatory   will have to seriously consider going back to windows for my next laptop update              it s not only the hardware that has gone downhill  but their customer service as well   apparently  when i brought it in to the apple store to be sent for repair  the serial numbers were mismatched somehow that resulted not only in at least a week and half delay  will be receiving my laptop    days after i dropped it off  but i had to spend   hours with customer service  including a two hour phone call  yes  you read that right  where i talked to a tech manager who said the mismatch in store was the  st time he s ever seen that in    yrs   and the ambient light sensor failing in a macbook  usually happens in phone  is something he almost never sees  too   so either i was extremely unlucky or  more likely  the quality of both their hardware design q a and their customer service has gone precipitously downhill and to top it off  was chatting online with one of their customer support reps  who first informed me of the mismatched serial numbers   i then briefly voiced a couple of reasonable questions on how this could have happened  without being rude  and then this rep then completely ghosted the next    comments i wrote over    min   think that s the first time i ve ever been ghosted in a customer service chat the one thing i never really had questions or concerns about apple in the past was its competency   that s obviously not the case now and i m most likely going back to android for my next phones and tablets  as well ,UK,0.9812,positive

456,to start i want to give full disclosure  i didn t buy this laptop on amazon and i have the   gb model  so my experience won t      match yours  as amazon only sells the  gb model to start  i am a pc guy  always have been and still am for the most part  intel mac laptops never really were appealing to me as they always seemed overpriced for the performance you would get  and as such apple laptops never really stood out to me  well that was  until apple silicon released  when i first heard the announcement for apple silicon  i was skeptical it could compete with intel chips  but when i saw the benchmarks  i knew apple had created something special first  the battery life  i usually get around    hours on a charge with a normal workload of word processing  watching videos and listening to music at around half brightness  a long shot from the advertised    hours of battery life  but that figure was taken with ideal circumstances and lower brightness  now    hours battery on a laptop isn t unheard of  but considering the other two strengths of the laptop  performance and thermals  it more impressive than it would usually be performance is great  easily matching or beating much of intels   th gen lineup  and thermals are outstanding  in the few weeks i ve owned the laptop  i have only heard the fan turn on during benchmarks  and even at full load  the cpu barely gets above    degrees c  far lower than the toasty    degrees that the intel chips get to under load the screen is great  but as an apple product that is to be expected now all of this is great  but it all comes with one massive caveat  rosetta  now rosetta is great  it allows basically all intel software to run on the computer  and this is great if you are a pro user waiting on software developers to update to native code  but its bad if you have  for example  chat software that hasn t been updated  even simple programs running under rosetta chew the battery life  and that isn t ideal at all in the end  this laptop is great  it is very powerful  quit  cool  and fast  the only thing currently holding it back is lack of native software support  and as apple silicon matures i expect that issue to be solved eventually  overall i would highly recommend this laptop to anyone that is willing to pony up the steep asking price ,UK,0.998,positive
457,i have had my macbook pro m    gb     gb storage  for   or   months now    i can honestly say i regret purchasing this so much  it works well a lot of the time but there s too many little issues that ve piled up at this point  people familiar with mac  no need to read on  if you are used to working on a windows machine  read this before proceeding conclusion  the chip is fast and it s an awesome piece of hardware  but the laptop is fairly clunky and buggy when extending to montiors working together with displaylink  if your primary use case will not be external monitors  then i think you will be pleased  if you do extend the display  you re in for a treat pros greater battery life   it s true  this thing lasts a long timegreat screen   i am a big fan of the high resolution which lets you see more of the screen  and it s a bright screen as well good sound   the built in speakers sound very solidgeneral performance   when it comes to web pages and the like  it performs well  i am not a power user and thus haven t really  pushed  this thing with any depending programs so i can t speak to thatcons compatibility   i have used this by itself as well as with a dell d     docking station which requires displaylink  i am extending to dual dell         p    hz monitors  for whatever reason  displaylink hates mac    very often  chrome safari will crash on launch  i can t emphasize this annoyance enough  yes  i ve circumvented the problem by finnicking with the displaylink program and unplugging replugging in the thunderbolt cable    it shouldn t have to come to that when i try and listen with my airpods  a lot of the time the bluetooth connection will drop and the sound will want to play out of my laptop external speakers another thing on performance   as mentioned above  it generally performs well  but honestly this thing takes too long to start up after being fully powered off  i had a laptop with an ssd before that turned on probably  x quicker than this  and certain programs like spotify take a surprising amount of time to load  one thought  i saw a video of someone clicking through and opening all the programs on their dock and they popped up immediately  this laptop does not do that ,UK,0.9932,positive

460,i love the seamless integration and interactions it has with my apple watch  airpods  and iphone  i know people who don t have more than one apple device hear all the time that having more than one always works great because of the ecosystem but usually only take it at face value  i was one of those people even up until i had my apple watch for a while but the macbook really hooked me in  once you realize how everything just works you don t know how you were able to do it before  of course there is the whole walled garden argument everyone that dislikes apple love to talk about but in reality i don t care if this walled garden is at war the rest of the world it s the best  most simple  and seamless ecosystem for the average consumer  there is a learning curve for those that come from other operating systems like the different feel of the keyboard  shortcuts  trackpad  and overall os  but i ve only been using this device for short while and already caught on super quick  i feel like despite all these positives there is still the high price  i purchased the     gb model and it came to around       with a sale so it might take a while for the slight buyer s remorse to go away but i feel like the more i use it the quicker i become satisfied with my purchase  my final thoughts would have to be  if you have the money to purchase this at any configuration then go for it  simply keep in mind there is a lot that goes into the satisfaction for this product  the ecosystem which would require more apple devices  the willingness to learn a new os  understanding the added level of security and privacy that comes with apple devices and the use case for each individual ,UK,0.9883,positive

513,i primarily use my macbook pro for music production and performance  as such  logic pro and myriad amp models plugins are constantly in use on my machine  the m  chip blows the intel chips out of the water in terms of loading speed  battery life  and ability to handle large logic projects with dozens of tracks  plugins  software instruments  and live recordings battery life has also seen a significant improvement over my      intel machine  i am not quite getting double the battery life  but it s not far off  this isn t a huge deal for me  as my machine is typically stationary and a charging cable is readily available  but for someone who needs the portability  the difference is substantial update          i have been using this laptop for over   months now on a daily basis  i have done everything from word documents  email  web surfing  logic pro  neural dsp guitar plugins  adobe lightroom  adobe illustrator  and many other tasks and i do not think that i have even heard the fan come on   time  it s pretty astounding  the m  is still exceedingly snappy and the battery life blows me away  and while more and more apps become native to m   i d expect performance to do nothing but improve ,UK,0.9436,positive

519,starting in the early      s i became a strictly apple girl for all electronic devices  i love the easy integration between devices and as a person with a disability it means a lot to have that interconnect ability  i previously had a macbook pro from      and it was malfunctioning badly  the replacement cost exceeded its value so invested that repair cost into this macbook pro  it s come a long way since       i love how light weight it is  i swear it s lighter than my macbook air from      was  i like the touch display but i mainly only use it for emojis    i had big sur on my previous mac but it ran slow  this macbook works so much faster than what i had before  the screen is brilliant and gorgeous  i had read this macbook could run any app on my phone  the reality is it s only a few apps  what i wanted to work the most was instagram  and that does not work on this  there are several apps though and that s a nice feature i m not techie from a hardware position but i am an advanced user from a software perspective and i am really happy with this this ,UK,0.9855,positive
520,it s a solid apple product  and i was way overdue to get a laptop  i researched and considered several pre owned models  but the cost on this macbook pro and the m  chip made it a clear choice  with used refurbished computers  there are still risks  not to mention lower battery life and physical damage  with a brand new machine  those chances are almost completely gone i m so glad i went with the new macbook pro  and if i decide to  upgrade   i know this machine will hold its value in the used market ,UK,0.88,positive
521,i purchased this laptop because my previous laptop  a behemoth of a gaming laptop  broke suddenly broke down  it was great  except for the fact that it felt a little slow  maybe it is because i had downgraded from a    hz screen to a   hz screen  or maybe because my previous laptop was a performance monster  it just didn t feel that good  however  other than that  it is an amazing laptop  very portable  and doesn t really heat up that much  also  it charges super fast  therefore i could charge it for    min to   hour in the morning and go the the whole day without having to worry about charging it  overall  it is an amazing product  however  it wasn t the one for me ,UK,0.9349,positive

560,i have had countless laptops and desktops  some that are even more expensive than this one  i ve never been more content with a computer before  i don t even know where to begin  the best part is probably how fast it is  i bought it early one and have had it for about a year and a half  i do everything on it from studying  to watching movies  to downloading games  it seems just as fast and smooth as it did before  i even was able to partition the hard drive to get windows and you would be surprised at its ability to run games at medium graphics settings as well  battery life is also stellar  i don t know what the advertised length is  but just to give you a clue i leave for lecture every morning with      battery  use it anywhere between      hours throughout the day  and always return home with a lot of battery life to spare  no more lugging around chargers in your backpack  display is awesome i don t really have any cons to it  anything  negative  is really just small stuff  and the only thing i can think of is i just wish it had more ports  but that is really nitpicking  i honestly don t use the touch bar that much  but it looks cool and doesn t really take up space if you don t use it so that does not matter  if you re looking for a laptop that is a jack of all trades  this is it ,UK,0.9268,positive

566,i m a fan of apple products and i like almost everything about this new mba  but it has one huge flaw that nobody talks about  it s the camera hardware and it hasn t been updated in ages  my zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light  a       laptop with    year old front camera is unacceptable  camera is very important to me  especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time ,UK,-0.4864,negative

568,update              after three weeks  i m still really impressed with the m  macbook air   core cpu   core gpu     ssd  gb ram      my updated plea  make sure you get as much memory   storage as you can afford  special order one to your projected future need remember  macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in   or even    years  not that long ago     gb hard drives were huge    and upgradable  ram was upgradable  the ssd and the ram in these machines is not upgradable the one issue for me has been that i am a memory hog  i tend to have lots of tabs open at once  i ve caught myself with     safari  open in one browser and     chrome  in another    while running affinity final cut pro   and yes  the dreaded beach ball has reared it s ugly head  well  this got me to assess what i will be using the machine for and for how long storage can be added with external drives  slower  but it will let you scrape by  ram is another story  when you constantly use up ram  the system starts using  swap memory  where it uses the ssd to store temporary files  one of the youtube reviewers  created labs  explains it like this  ram memory is like writing on a white board  it s made to be temporary  writing to the ssd is like writing on paper with a pencil  it can be erased  but if it s written on and erased for too long  it s going to degrade the medium  it will take years for this to cause problems  but keep in mind that in these m  macbooks  none of the parts are replaceable  the ssd and the ram are soldered onto the board    as ridiculously expensive as apple ram is  when it s not upgradable  get the maximum  in this case     gb i really doubt that apple will be making machines with user upgradable ram after the switch from intel is complete  except for possibly the very high end pro models there is also the fact that if i am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing  a m  with a fan will be helpful  upgrading to the cheaper       upgrades  m  mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the pro apps  but i need a laptop  so    so  that is why i m planning to return this machine and get one  likely the macbook pro m    with    gb ram     tb ssd    a note on browsers  safari is by far the best browser to run on the m   at least for now  i always had issues with saving web pages as pdf files in chrome  where it did not save most of the images text on the page  in safari  it s worked perfectly       i purchased the macbook air m     core gpu  and   core cpu model  with     gb ssd and   gb ram in person at the apple store               with education pricing  i traded in my  mnyh ll a             macbook with the intel m  processor      gb ssd    gb ram  i kept my charging adapter   c cable  which are both compatible with the m  late      macbook air   so ended up with a      apple store instant credit towards the m  the m  model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open  including final cut   logic pro  admittedly the      mb was the bottom of the line and i suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single c port fiasco i likely would have gone with the   core gpu model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase  but i wanted     gb of ssd space  so i paid more by going with eh   core  from everything that i ve seen  the lack of more ram upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the intel x   processors and is really only useful when you have many gpu intensive  pro apps  running at the same time i would never have dreamed of running final cut or logic pro on the      macbook  so this has been an amazing upgrade for me i would say that the bottom line is that if you re someone who only uses a laptop for office   basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once  and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball  not responding  issues  or if you have non apple programs that have not been compiled for the m  chip  hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the m   if however  you really need a machine that is much more capable  faster and cooler running than the intel models  it s a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non upgradable mac ,UK,0.9727,positive
569,the m  chip really is amazing  but it only lasted five days for me  somehow mine managed to break after using a third party usb c hub  the screen wouldn t turn on at all  and an apple repair tech couldn t figure it out after doing a few quick tests  oh and then apple said it would take a month to replace it with a new one ,UK,0.726,positive

571,i have two macbook airs  mba   a     and a     both with the previous form factor  the wide  body colored bezel around the screen      x    resolution  and this new     mba improves upon it in every way  almost  and makes it nearly perfect good   screen looks great       x     resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel   i usually don t go above     brightness   keyboard is good   some have mentioned that it still sucks  but i find it much better than the older mbas that i own and better than say  the magic keyboard   even with a thin silicone keyboard cover i find the typing experience to be much better and i can type faster and with fewer mistakes   battery life is fantastic   haven t done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors  wifi usage  video streaming  hd vs  k video viewing processing etc   screen brightness  type of app being used  etc   but for my usage  mostly web browsing  video viewing on youtube  accessing vpn for work  citrix  epic   etc   it has been great   easily tops    hours and super impressed so far   looks great   love the newer  i know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now  design  looks and feels great   form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight   no fan   that s awesome  as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap   pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans   performance   it works great so far on what i have used it for  which is not terribly a lot  but it is what it is for a laptop using apple silicon for the first time   for just day to day use and things like chrome  office  word  excel   citirx  epic  etc   it has been super smooth and fast   have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with   core gpu   also  things like start up are noticeably faster with the m  versus my      imac      top end  with intel chips   touch id is great still   works very fast and the button does not get greasy  which makes it not work well  like the old iphone home buttons   on the other hand  it should really have face id at this point   apple ecosystem is great as usual and a real reason to get this mba   apple watch easily unlocks it  so you do not really need face id if you have the watch    you can easily send receive files using airdrop or cast using airplay   and so on and so forth   big sur comes preinstalled but you need to update to get        not good   webcam still sucks   still low resolution and just does not look good in facetime  teams  etc   shame that apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the macs  the     imac finally upgraded to     p front cams only a couple months ago    i got one and it looks so much better than this mba s camera    only   ports   sad that this thing has only   usb c ports  that cover thunderbolt    usb      charging  displayport    given that it is used to charge  it leaves only one usb c port for other use  pretty lame   i wish they had squeezed  i think it would fit  a usb a port so that i could plug in my wireless mouse usb a dongle as i have never liked any bluetooth mouse  or at least one more usb c port   new tech  apple silicon  means the m  optimized apps are still being rolled out  e g  photoshop still not available at release   battery still cannot be removed  no surprise here  but means that like all apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non removable battery   easier to have an iphone s battery replaced than a mba i would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for   years at the minimum overall a few negatives  mostly the webcam  but enough significant improvements that this mba is really a no brainer for anyone needing a non power notebook compute  especially if s he is already in the apple ecosystem   love it so far ,UK,0.9995,positive

573,lightweight  blazing fast  easy to use  battery life is incredible with the new apple m  chip   a typical great apple product however  there is only a thunderbolt port  so you now have to go out and buy a cable to convert usb to thunderbolt  if you want to use a backup hard drive  or other usb items  and  i had to buy yet another cable to sync my phone s lightning port to the thunderbolt port on the computer  total     i love apple product  and worked for them in my caerer  but i would wait on buying this version until the software for it has been developed update  after several months of using this computer  i have have found several things of concern     my notification center keeps disappearing  despite my constant reinstalling the widgets     my computer s calendar  reminders  and photo stream do not sync with my ios devices  iphone   ipad    if i add an item to calendar on my phone  it will appear on my mac but not vice versa   reminders will not sync regardless of which device i originate the item on i have contacted apple support on all these issues and they cannot solve the problem it appears that the bugs have not been worked out  yet   things are maddeningly clunky ,UK,0.891,positive

581,i m a software developer and i ve only used pc for my entire career  i ve been using the windows subsystem for linux and other unix based shells for work for a long time and i ve always had the desire to try development on a mac i assumed that it would be like any other windows machine that s had the os replaced with linux  one of my favorite computers was a lenovo with ubuntu on it so that s what i expected i bought a surface pro x which has an arm based processor  ms sq  chip  so i thought that i knew what to expect  i assumed that it would be frustrating that the majority of the software i used probably wouldn t work correctly but i have to say that apple did so much better than microsoft on this one  the m  chip makes this        laptop feel like a       laptop  i ve only run into one application that couldn t run and the general online community recommended an alternative for me the most difficult thing for me was getting used to the different keyboard layout but once i did  this laptop has been nothing short of a pleasure to work with and has replaced my surface laptop   as my daily driver and primary software development machine i might revert to my surface laptop three if i go back to  net development in the future but for the general web stuff i typically do  i couldn t ask for a better machine the battery life is excellent  this laptop feels premium  i have no doubt that this will last me well into the future and it has completely changed my mind about apple the biggest downside in my opinion is that i spent a fortune on accessories and peripherals because apple products tends to exist in their own separate ecosystem which can be a bit frustrating one thing that everyone should be aware of is that you can t connect this laptop to two separate external displays  i had to get used to one external display and then using a virtual desktop  that is unfortunate because i really liked having three monitors at all times but i haven t found a way to make it work with this machine generally speaking  i would recommend this to anybody who s considering it  unless you are a pc gamer  there s very little that this computer won t excel at  i d argue that it might be the best quality laptop in this price range by a factor of two  and i have historically been very critical of apple ,UK,0.9584,positive

583,if i could go back i probably would though past the time now i d say i m computer savvy  spent years of time on windows programs  photoshop etc  now that my current dell inspiron is reaching the end of its life  i followed all the great reviews and purchased this macbook air m  everything is hard  i actually loved my dell in many ways  though hopefully its life  around     years  is about half what this mac will be things i m missing the most so far  a touch screen  the ability to fully open ie fold back and flatten the rotation the screen  even the fact of needing to use   fingers to take screen shots instead of an allocated button  the delete button is actually a back space not delete button  notifications keep coming in upper right corner  blocking what i might want to access there  one needs to go through each app to change the setting btw  there s no default to say do not show notifications  it would at least be good to have the option to change the location of where they show up  i much prefer chrome to safari  though found on reading that chrome eats up a lot more power  i downloaded flotata this morning which is supposed to help though i haven t tried yet  incredibly frustrating especially when time is very limited  trying to figure things out   have spent hours on calls with apple support which thankfully is very accessible  but my computer seems glitchy  sometimes the screen sharing doesn t work  i haven t purchased a mouse as yet for it and also finding  right clicking  with   finger tapping to be frustrating and not working as i d expect it to overall unfortunately not a happy camper  maybe for mac users it may be a good machine for whatever reason i was also very torn whether to get the   or   gb  i went with the    i don t think that would make a difference at this early stage of being new i also tried to have my teen daughter  who s used to macs  give me tips though she was t terribly helpful so i watched a couple of youtube vids which gave some guidance  things are not intuitive i don t like posting negative reviews  though sharing this in case others in similar situations ie needing to carry on with trying to get things done  while their windows laptop is reaching the end of its life and needing to choose a new machine  may find this helpful also as an fyi  i had to pay an additional nearly      to have my   external hard drives transferred onto a new mac compatible one  so i can access all my previous work wishing everyone better luck ,UK,0.8367,positive

588,update i saw some reviews that said their  rd party usb hub broke their mac  i ve been using a usb c to usb a for a few weeks now with no problems  made by uni   it s worked for everything i threw at it  logitech g    keyboard  razor mouse  yamaha digital piano  rme audio interface  roland a    midi keyboard  they all worked  i also have a cheapo amazon basics single usb adaptor cord about    long  and it too works with everything on the macbook after decades of looking through bill gates  windows  i bought my first mac but only because of the new m  chip  where everything is on this one chip  which makes it faster  applications optimized for the m  now rival high end pcs  and for the first time too   i never was interested in macs because they were overpriced and underpowered  but it looks like that worm has turned  just don t buy an earlier version of macs  especially with intel chips keep in mind when if you buy this  there are no upgrades later on  zero  nada  nothing to change out  you can t add ram nor storage once it s built   there is a workaround on storage  by adding an external ssd drive  but as i understand it there are some problems viewing what is on your external drive  but that may change over time  also  ssd storage  while blazingly fast and so worth it  need about      headroom   that is for example  if you have    gb storage  you can only use    gb as you need a     reserve to account for ssds getting used up  it s the nature of the beast  and of course the preinstalled software also takes up storage space from day one  for my pc i bought a    gb ssd and found that it was maxing out pretty fast  so i replaced with a  tb ssd and have already filled up half of it  but i don t expect to fill it up completely anytime soon  it should be good for maybe a decade or so so bottom line  get at least the    gb storage or you ll be sorry  it does kind of suck that apple charges so much for each step increase in storage  but paying the extra      in this case is worth it  imho  the jury is still out on if you need   bg of ram vs the  gb models currently in stock   apple treats it like a custom order at this time  with a waiting period    if it was a pc  then getting   gb ram is a no brainer  but in the case of the m  chip  it shares memory within the chip  making the most use of it  i have   gb in my pc because ram sticks are relatively cheap remember  once you buy a macbook  it will stay as is  upgrades are impossible  which has always been the case for notebooks anyway  ,UK,0.8833,positive

596,buying into the apple ecosystem should only be done to make products for the ecosystem which will make the user money  but  do not make them a critical part of your workflow   they are too expensive for that   apple just does not make good computers   yes  they make a ok operating system  but they make computers that cannot be repaired by taking out the ssd or ram sticks and putting new ones in you can t just go and buy the parts to fix your mac computers when they break   the macbook air is no exception to this   the ssd is solider to the motherboard   likewise the ram   now  if that were the only problem  well    one would be able to get someone skilled to replace these broken pieces after apple stop warranty coverage    maybe   but  they don t even allow the suppliers of these chips to supply them to the public   so  once the warranty is  up    you will not be able to get spare parts for the computer   needless to say  this is a major flaw in apple products    of which it is no exception for this macbook air    oh  and if they start allowing suppliers to supply  but  lock down with crypto keys to a particular machine we just have even more e waste  also  this computer flickers with a  k output   the macbook air has screen flicker with an external monitor using the hootoo dock that i ve used with an intel macbook pro which is a few years old   this is unacceptable   apple s response to the sometimes frying the computer for using usb c docks that work with other computers is an example of the poorly built computer they are pushing though poorly engineered in terms of video  ssd  and ram   it is a wonderful typing experience when using the laptop keyboard   if you are willing to let that guide you  then  the computer may be worth it if you are willing to set aside another grand when ssd fails or you plug in the wrong dock to drive an external monitor even though someone else just had their intel mac plugged in and worked just fine    supposedly apple fix this with an os update    good for them  even though i dislike the mac  it is better than most laptops    because it is quiet since it has no fan   would i buy one again  perhaps    it is a question of whether i think the market exists for me to make money off of it the good things keyboard  touchpad  built in screen  build in speakers  drives external audio better than microsoft windows  and the operating system is less cluttered than is windows   also  comes with a spreadsheet  word processor  presentation program    now  it is better just to use something really libre    like libreoffice   but  it is kind of nice the table steaks are included    unlike for microsoft windows ,UK,0.0527,positive

601,this machine is not powerful enough to run design software and google chrome at the same time  just fyi  it s laggy  sputters  and a total piece of junk for the most part if you re trying to run any of adobe suite or sketchup or heavy ish program  it has trouble runing keynote  spotify  and chrome at the same time  this is great for surfing the web and using a few of the internal apple products but a complete waste of money if you re looking for a work computer and do any kind of creative design or work  apple s products are garbage and we re all stuck in their hellish ecosphere ,UK,-0.8464,negative
602,i have used microsoft windows based computers      since        now for the  st time i decided to try apple out instead to see how windows compares to a macbook   only been a few days and i already see things unfamiliar i am learning  so far   i have to say the speed of the new m  processor compared to any of the windows    computers is very impressive and just the speed and  faster response  the macbook seems to have combined with the programs i have downloaded and a few i purchased i would have to say i prefer the macbook   i added a   port usb hub and a trackball i use instead of the built in pad but other then that i have not changed a thing   it definitely does everything i need it to do both business related an for pleasure   i also enjoy the small portable size and will be taking it on it s first trip in just a few days   if anyone is a current windows user and is considering the switch to try out a macbook i would say go for it and do not look back    if you purchase one and later decide you would prefer not to stick with it a macbook seems to hold their value much better then the majority of windows based computers out there ,UK,0.9724,positive

607,i love this little computer  when i was looking for a laptop to buy  i almost went with a used  older macbook air  i decided to just spend the extra money and get a brand new computer and the newest model and i m so happy i did because apple s m  chip is impressive  after two months of owning this laptop  i think my favorite thing is the battery life  for lighter tasks  web browsing  listening to music  steaming netflix etc   the battery could last the entire day  and i love how i can take this thing anywhere with me without having to lug a charger around as well  for heavier tasks  it of course doesn t last all day but you get a lot of hours out of the battery  it rarely gets hot  and doesn t even have a fan  so you know how efficient that chip is running  i also love the fanless design because i can have it with me in my bed or anywhere and not worry about blocking vents or getting dog hair in those fans  i don t use it for anything crazy  mainly just work and personal stuff  along with frequent streaming and occasionally i ll fire up the sims    and it runs beautifully by the way   but i m never not impressed by how quick it is  opens applications almost instantly and wakes instantly  also  i am new to mac with this purchase but have owned iphones for a decade and i love the seamless integration jumping between applications on your laptop and phone  so far i m loving big sur and basically this is just a laptop that would be great for almost anyone ,UK,0.9947,positive

632,so for the most part i use this for when i am traveling or out and about for my business  i find it the right size for the job i am doing and take advantage of apples cloud storage and ways of using other mac s as storage for information so this doesn t use storage much at all  where this is nice is the quick user functionality it has in access these documents or programs needed seamlessly and being able to help keep my business moving on the road  most of the time i am using browser programs to access the business info or using the cloud to access files back at the home base which is the new mac mini with an external hard drive that houses the business information  i find that the size makes a great traveling companion for onsite work  when connecting to a shared internet connection it is nice knowing that the channel is mostly secure and when using my iphone shares cell connection and new chips they can help create a safe network for my means of work  if you are debating getting one for business i recommend using their cloud storage so you eliminate the focus on storage anxiety and makes it more worth it in the long run of having a user interface focused laptop  also the battery for most of the work i am doing lasts me a week with heavy workload   days max  honestly you can t get too much better for a long lasting apple hardware focused product ,UK,0.9897,positive

636,i have always wanted a macbook  ever since i was a little kid  but  there was always something that stopped me from getting one  they always mentioned that the air wasn t very good  from      all the way up to       reviews always mentioned the multiple flaws macbook air had  from the thermal throttling  to the super small ssd      at base price   over        then the butterfly keyboard etc  the list went on and on  and i really thought that it wasn t worth the money  until  wwdc       apple announced they would start making their own chips straight from home  i was so excited for this new generation  it reminded me of the time when they went from powerpc to intel  the excitement was there  and i loved the new unibody that started in       with the removal of unnecessary ports for the average joe  everything was the same  but the new m  chip  that is when i realized that this m  macbook air was the one for me  i didn t hesitate and started saving until i had enough to buy it  and  i absolutely made the best decision in purchasing it  it is amazing  it s super slim  portable  super fast processing speed and power  the screen is beautiful  the bezels are unnoticeable  the keyboard is outstanding  to be completely honest  this laptop makes you want to be more productive  just because of its speed and its ease of use  if you re thinking about purchasing a mac  this by far is one of the better choices  and the cheapest nonetheless  the charger is also outstanding    w is all you need for this little thing ,UK,0.9979,positive
637,this was my first mac purchase  the quality  engineering  craftmanship is top notch  surprisingly not hard to adapt to using coming from a pc  very happy   absolutely love all the very helpful features  still discovering new ones   faster ways to do things on it everyday  plus it looks like a million bucks   very nice addictive feel to the the touch   can t say enough good things about macbook air   apple     you ve hit a grand slam with this one   the m  chip   thanks ,UK,0.9797,positive
638,i just love this macbook air   it replaced my      model that was an    inch model   it is like light years ahead of that computer  although the old one is wonderful too   the keyboard is smooth as silk and so easy to type on  i could go on and on about the screen   crisp  clear  bright  and wonderful   i really enjoy the backgrounds on big sur as well now   the speed with the m  chip is phenomenal on all the programs that i use youtube is a great place to get more technical reviews than i have left   but from an ordinary  person this laptop is fabulous ,UK,0.9687,positive
639,caveats  this is a mac  so like any other  software choice can be limited  it s also the new arm m  chip  so certain programs haven t caught up  as of early        especially virtualization  vmware  virtualbox  and languages  haskell    this is a    inch screen  so screen real estate is limited  i couldn t recommend this as a  daily driver   except maybe for school university   probably a great option if you re frequently on google meet or zoom overall  amazing battery life  unmatched  d power for the size   price  gorgeous screen with no color brightness lost when tilted nor lcd configuration needed to optimize color  white black levels  mac os big sur is constantly fast and responsive with smooth animation regardless of what is open running i ve bought a lot of laptops  but this one surprisingly nice   if you have to have windows  or have to stay        get a microsoft surface  great too   but if you need a mac or can afford the splurge  absolutely get this air m  ,UK,0.9741,positive
640,but  i love this laptop   after asking multiple people who have purchased the same  or better  models and i couldn t be happier purchasing even the lowest end model of macbook air   does everything i would expect an apple computer to do  for what i need it for  basic photo editing  viewing  and typing   so far it s been an amazing purchase   just for the sake of keeping apple on their toes i rated the battery life   stars and the camera quality   stars  as well as the   star overall review   keep it up apple  as long as you continue to make the products user friendly i ll remain a happy customer for years to come ,UK,0.9849,positive
641,i was scared jumping from my      mbp    to a mb air   but i wanted lighter and figured i could carry both if i need the power of my pro   ummmm  i don t need my pro   this thing blows my almost brand new intel based mbp   now  there have been some anomalies with different apps and things   no show stoppers   but you can clearly tell which apps were updated for the m  and which weren t  they work fine  but take a several seconds to open one process i use it for is livestreaming our church services using obs  and iphone and a usb audio device for the feed from the mixer   all of this is streamed only to fb live and recorded on machine   on the mbp  this all worked fine  but the battery couldn t keep up  even plugged in   had the same issue on my      mbp       but the m  does all of this without any issues from a power perspective   plus  it s much more stable for this use than the mbp   i would get a lot of sticking video on the mbp and have  so far  received none on the m  very happy with the price too   but  get as much memory and disk space as you can afford   can t have too much ,UK,0.9174,positive
642,i think you would have a hard time finding a windows laptop that did not support   external monitors   yet  this laptop  more advanced in every other way than pretty much any windows laptop in its price range  only supports a single external monitor   i would never have even thought to ask the question   absolutely unacceptable ,UK,0.2598,positive
643,first time macbook owner  really happy with the macbook air  don t let the lack of a fan be off putting  the only time it gets even remotely warm is when rendering a video in imovie  even then  it s by no means hot to the touch  this is probably the most fail proof laptop out right now and dare i say  ever  the lack of a fan eliminates the last mechanical part and means this laptop have no moving parts  the soldered in m   storage and committing to your ram choice for the life of the laptop is my only complaint  so far i m not finding  gb of ram to be an issue  most of the programs for mac os are pretty well optimized for the m  chip  so everything feels to work pretty smoothly  the battery life is next level  over all it s more powerful  cooler and the battery lasts longer than ever  if you have been wanting to get your first macbook or have been batting around the idea of an upgrade  this would not be a bad choice ,UK,0.9223,positive
644,replaced a macbook pro from work when i got laid off   i m not really an apple person  but know my way around   i am looking for tech writer job so creativity apps are priority   still need remote windows machine for rare missing software when connecting external dell monitor  it couldn t detect  or support   correct settings   cannot get image to fill full wide screen    worked flawlessly on macbook pro i miss right hand usb ports   nice screen resolution rosetta stone wasn t pre installed like review articles indicated   works well after painless install wifi connection not nearly as good as macbook pro   my routers    choices  orbi  synergy  motorola  are all wonky  old machine stayed connected for weeks  this one hops between networks multiple times per day  each time cancelling current network jobs love the battery life  nice portability  looks good   fast wake and fast reliable fingerprint recognition ,UK,0.9785,positive

646,i absolutely love this laptop  i m a software engineer and as you can imagine i spend a lot of time of the computer  this computer is lightning fast  a dream to type on  and it has a beautiful screen  the only downside is that camera quality  which is absolutely atrocious  i have a desktop pc that i do my web conferencing over anyways  so it s not big deal for me  if you really care about the webcam  i would suggest purchasing a third party webcam  other than that  i highly recommend this product and i could not be more pleased with it ,UK,0.9409,positive
647,we bought the laptop in dec       after a couple of weeks  it had a big os update  big sur to monterey  the problems started happening   i kept getting locked out  passwords not working  account name not working   resulting to my having to run to the mac service center  x the first time they said the update caused some issues  second one said  it was a file vault issue also  noticed how since the update my battery life has decreased  the tech guys said this is normal after an update due to the machine still settling and should stabilize soon  it s been a couple of weeks and still the same  i ve even heeded the advice of not logging out nor shutting down  just folding the laptop  to let the machine keep working on the kinks  also because it s an m  technology so no need to formally shut it down like a pc not sure of what s really going on  tbh perhaps it is due to apples newest os being buggy  or it could be the unit is a lemon  not sure  but giving it one last chance and if it fails me again before the    day warranty is up  i am returning it ,UK,-0.775,negative
648,the device is silent because it has no fans  the screen isn t oled but it looks incredible for watching movies with vibrant colors and is very sharp making it great for text documents with small fonts  the battery life is incredibly good i can constantly get over a day with moderate to high use and yet somehow still manages to be an incredibly light device  it has a good dac and plenty of volume making it a good choice for audio lovers  especially if you use open backs since it makes no noise  and if you don t use headphones the speakers can get very loud and sound really good for a laptop  it runs mac os which can be hard to adapt too but it is alot less power intensive than windows so you rarely have to worry about overheating or battery in daily use  if you are a professional video or photo editor or run intensive task look towards a pro computer and for everyone else this is a great choice ,UK,0.9909,positive
649,i ve worked on and serviced macs for many years  but i ve never considered purchasing one for the price  macs have never been a good value  i wanted a       laptop  and my choices quickly narrowed to this  it has the best laptop processor and the best screen money can buy  especially at this price  the battery life on macbooks is always good  so i knew that wouldn t be an issue after purchase  i ve come to the same conclusions  the screen is wonderful  bright and high res  excellent color accuracy  the m  processor speed has blown me away with its performance  i don t need much ram or storage  so i m still happy with that  i do wish for more ram  but i don t necessarily need it for my work i do  what has blown my mind more than anything else is the battery life  i ve never had a laptop like this  i don t have to carry a charger with me anymore  the macbook easily handles a full day of charge  i also like the fact that it doesn t have a fan  i don t have to worry about thermals when getting comfy in my bed and doing some light work overall  best laptop i ve ever purchased  i ve had no issues over more than a month of ownership  and i m super picky about tech as well as slightly anti apple  so i ve basically converted because of this machine ,UK,0.99,positive
650,couldn t use my usb had to buy a connector  doesn t connect to my canon printer   not compatible  amazon sold me a windows office package for it was supposed to work  not compatible  bought a care package for support and problems   no number to call  not worth the money ,UK,-0.6919,negative
651,i had my mac for one day before it quit working it was installed with big sur  which has a bug in it causing the trackpad to malfunction  no trackpad   no way of using your laptop  especially because it won t recognize an external mouse with this bug  i paid over a thousand dollars to have a computer for a single day  while it worked  the speed was great and the screen crystal clear  but both of those are pointless without a way to use the computer  i m doing the   hour software update now to  hopefully  fix the problem  but i highly recommend purchasing a different computer ,UK,0.8085,positive

653,this is the first apple computer i ve ever had and i adore my mac  i originally bought it for editing my videos for my youtube channel  rae of sun asmr  which is still its main function  now however  i almost prefer watching things like netflix  etc  on here vs on my actual television  picture quality on this thing is superior  highly recommend ,UK,0.908,positive
654,this is the bargain deal of the apple lineup at the moment  the m  chip gives it crazy power management which equates to ridiculously long battery life  incredibly low temperature operation which needs no fan so also absolute silence  all this while running circles around the competitors offerings which don t stand a chance of keeping up with this incredible product  with their m  chip apple has not just revolutionized the capabilities of a laptop but turned the whole computer industry upside down  and yes it is extremely well made out of a solid chunk of aluminum  is very light and has a world class screen and a redesigned keyboard that feels wonderful  incase you couldn t tell i like and recommend this laptop ,UK,0.958,positive
655,excellent battery  speedy  lightweight  you do not often come across these three benefits together  this is still a great purchase if you  like me  do the regular zoom meetings  graphic design  edit  k video  some spreadsheet work and occasionally edit batches of     photos in raw format in lightroom  go spend some more in a m  pro or max if you really need that much computational power for  d or heavy  k video editing ,UK,0.9169,positive
656,this low end macbook air performs incredibly  it handles lightroom and photoshop like it s nothing  i can t believe the battery life as well   it ll run all day  i don t know how apple did it  but they did  very satisfied with this laptop ,UK,0.7086,positive
657,not long ago i decided to get far from apple products because some work necessities i couldn t cover with an iphone and a mac  the limitation of the iphone for some advanced features  like dual sim and the possibility to flash os images from a ssd  and the need to use bootcamp in the mac made me jump to an android phone and a windows computer i had a samsung s    and a huawei matebook pro with windows and linux  both devices are impeccable  really made my work easier in so many aspects  but as time passed my life wasn t getting simpler like it was with my iphone and my mac apple products work flawlessly between each other and there are always new implementations that simplifies everyday life  quality of this products and its software is incredible  although other products have better capabilities   for example my matebook outperforms this macbook air m  and has a much better quality screen  they lack the simplicity and stability being all this said  the macbook air m  is a really great laptop  the most basic version which is the one i bought is blazing fast  stable and with a great battery life  much better than the huawei matebook pro   also its absolute silent and fresh  its doesn t get hot at all to make my work easier i had to pay for some software that saddly i was denied to pay on the mac at the beginning   apple products are expensive but i ve learned that in the long run they are worth it  life is about time and how you spend it and apple definitely focus its effort to simplify the time you use to do a task i wanted to share my story in case you are in a situation like i had  if you have an iphone and other apple products don t doubt  buy a macbook air m   i still have a beefy windows machine for gaming  rendering  and other things  but most of the time i rather work in my new macbook ,UK,0.9912,positive
658,can t add much that hasn t already been said  i upgraded from a      macbook air and find this to be superior in just about every way  the battery life is at least twice what the      was  the screen is much better  the keyboard is better  the overall size of the computer is smaller and i love the larger haptic feedback touchpad  i don t use the camera but it isn t the greatest from what i understand and i do kind of miss the magsafe connector ,UK,0.9044,positive
659,overall  highly recommended  the m  macbook air really brings the quality for speedy and responsive user experience  great build quality and excellent audio  the air is incredibly quiet and the battery life is stellar  this is really the one to buy for this generation  m   for cost and productivity  you still need a good usb hub to get more connections but this leaves the unit highly portable  it s a reasonable trade off  for now we have not noted any memory system issues and we got the     gb hard drive model so that there would be more read write space  a bigger hard drive makes a difference  ,UK,0.7137,positive
660,my first day  i ve used macbooks since      when the first intel processors were used  the m  chip is amazing  i now understand why   gb of ram is perfect for this model  crystal clear text rendering  silky smooth touch pad  nice tactile response on keyboard  big improvement over the troublesome keyboards of the last   years  speakers are lovely  very pleased  battery fully charged  was able to easily migrate from my old      macbook retina     easy to connect with icloud and mac account  a couple of my non apple apps required rosetta to run with m  processor smooth download of rosetta  anyone needing a high end camera might go for the macbook pro but this is fine for my needs ,UK,0.9062,positive
661,i only have one thing i didn t like     it actually has nothing to do with the computer i love the computer but when the delivery guy destroyed our yard because they drove through it and got stuck is really aggravating  this is not the first time they have done this  and we have asked multiple times not to do it  we have multiple areas where amazon workers have drove in our yard and messed it up   they tell us that they will fix it but never do  my mother in law  and father in law are pissed so be prepared for a call from them    ,UK,-0.9148,negative
662,i had several problems so took the macbook air into best buy for help   i was told i had received  a lemon  and should return it to amazon   i had it   weeks so was able to return it for a refund which i am waiting for right now   i have loved my      macbook air and am hoping the next one i order will be okay ,UK,0.926,positive

665,every older generation is practically the same  if you are interested in getting any mac the macbook air late      model will fit all your needs and if cleaned properly will work like new  all airs can last extremely long  good quality laptop m  chip is very powerful but     of users wont be able to use this mac to its full capacity honestly  but if you looking for an upgrade this is it  beautiful look  sleek design  light  powerful  will last from freshman year of college to well in post grad career  i say every mac with proper care can last a good     years then should be handed down to a friend  i gave my last mac book air        away when i got this and my friends says the best laptop they ever had  again only mac worth buying new if you already own one and want to upgrade      of those who will use it wont need the power and capacity it comes with ,UK,0.9943,positive
666,what i liked  apple s construction quality is second to none  unboxing this is a delight  it s just a beautiful machine  you can start working with it as soon as the initial setup is done  which might take a few minutes  love the display  bright colors  nice resolution  everything looks crisp  keys are a delight to type with  real smooth  battery life is the best i ve ever witnessed  i just recharge this thing every other day  whereas my previous laptop would use three rounds of charge a day  and i had for just one year  what i disliked  some of my favorite apps are still not ready for apple silicon or m  chip  it s given me two or three random reboots with cryptic error logs already  and coming from over    years using mostly windows  and some     years using linux  i feel like i have to rewire my brain to start using the fn  control  option   command keys properly all in all  it s a really solid laptop although i feel like i still haven t made the most out of it  no heavy usage so far  except for some minor audio production work  guess i ll do it eventually  hope app compatibility gets better with time too  that s the reason for the missing star up there  otherwise  it would ve been   stars all the way ,UK,0.9866,positive
667,likes  happy wifebut seriously  i m not a macos user  personally  but my wife is and she loves it  her old      macbook pro could finally be put to rest these machines last a long time  the battery life easily lasts her two full days of use  probably around    hours  as a nurse  she s constantly looking up new techniques or reviewing current literature  so her next laptop needed to be power efficient  but powerful the m  does just that the screen quality is second to none as you can expect from apple products this particular mac       macbook air m      does not have the touchbar that thepros do   and we re glad  it felt out of place when we were trying out the new lineup of macs this air also has the  new  keyboard  which is just apple going back to their old style of chiclet keyboard a fan favorite also  this air never gets hot  this is something new to me as i m used to devices running too hot after long usage  but the air s m  is so efficient the laptop doesn t need a fan ,UK,0.9891,positive
668,the m  chip is amazing and a miracle  this little chip can play some of the most cpu demand games around cities skylines it played phenomenal without any lag or freezing  this macbook air is very powerful  the downside to it  is that it doesn t have a cooling fan and one cooling fan in it would make a major improvement ,UK,0.9608,positive

670,i bought this      macbook air    gb ram      gb ssd storage  to replace a      macbook air   gb ram      gb ssd storage    i am undeniably a fan of apple products in general  because they work with little fuss and are built to last  note that my old macbook air is more than   years old and still working perfectly    although i ve been underwhelmed by some mac models in recent years  this one is stellar imho   unless you have very heavy system requirements this machine would be an excellent choice the m  processor is very impressive  delivering outstanding performance and power thermal efficiency simultaneously   battery life is every bit as good as advertised  i can charge overnight and use it all day without plugging in   connecting usb devices such as external drives will shorten battery life  but that s to be expected   i love the fanless design  which means the machine is absolutely silent at all times  while the thermal efficiency of the m  chip allows it to remain amazingly cool   in use  this computer feels very fast  especially with apps optimized for apple processors  as macos big sur is    interestingly  microsoft has been on board early with m  optimization  the latest office     version is smooth and fast on this machine   i also tried out ms edge on my new laptop based on a recommendation from another user and have been so pleased with its speed and efficiency that it s my current default browser   the touch id and apple pay capability is a welcome addition the only cons i see are minor in my opinion   because ram is integrated into the m  processor  post purchase memory expansion is not possible  if you think you ll need    gb of memory that model can be had from the apple store   there has been criticism of the fact that this machine has only two ports  which is fair   for me that s not insurmountable  i simply use a usb c hub to provide additional connectivity   i ve read recently that some users have had certain hubs cause problems with their m  macs  which appears to be related to battery charging through these hubs   to be on the safe side i use a built in port for charging and have had no issues reading through the relative handful of critical reviews  it looks to me like most  excluding actual defects  which happen with all products  are based on lack of understanding   for example  i saw a large number of reviews complaining that this machine  has no usb ports      which is patently false   in fact  its two ports are both usb  they just require a different connector   what these users are looking for is the old usb a connectors  which this macbook does not have  however  that s easily fixed by using a usb a to usb c converter cable  or with a usb c hub   usb a peripherals are gradually disappearing as well  in favor of the new connector all things considered  i really love this machine   the      price  at the time i bought mine  was      less than i would have paid at the apple store  and i believe i can probably get      on ebay for my old macbook air  try that with a   year old pc   leaving me with a total outlay of        considering that i ll almost certainly get   or more years use out of this model  i m very happy with my purchase and would do it again ,UK,0.9959,positive

678,i love this laptop  from the small apple logo that i see as a mirror on the screen part of the laptop to the keyboard  everything is awesome things i loved  battery is great  got it delievered around  pm and when i got home i immediately turned it on and it was around     battery  ive been on it all day night and its at     screen  the brightness it great  i can anything i want with the easy controls and i can the colors are so vibrant and pleasing to look at keyboard  i am one who is stuck in the keyboard hobby and i know what is and isnt a good keyboard  the one on this macbook is quite nice  it has a nice sound and feel to it  i love the amount of key travel on it considering it is a small laptop that doesnt even weigh   pounds speakers  i love that even with the first level of volume on i can still hear it quite clearly  the sound of the speakers is insane and that fact that apple even added the spekers to the sides od the keyboard too is even better  almost like surround sound design  i love the sleek and slender design of the laptop its so minimalistic and i love that so much  there isnt any big details on the outside or inside which i like   although this may not be a good part of the review as this is kinda based off of the buyers opinion s  tldr  the battery is very very good  long lasting  the screen is also very pleasing to look at  the colors truly do show themselves on this laptop and the brightness control is also very nice to have  the keyboard is very nice quality and sounds nice and feels nice to type on  teh speakers almost act as surround sound because they are on both sides of me and have a very nice output of the sound  lastly  the design is sleek and minimalistic and i love that oh and did i mention that the touch pad is also very nice  its like the home button on the iphone   and    it doesnt actually click it just feels like it which i happen to like too,UK,0.9983,positive
679,best laptop you can buy but mine came scratched idk why apple is trying to punish me for but it s fine  also be really careful because the screen is special  it has a coating for retina display and even touching it or gently cleaning it can remove some of the coating and leave subtle blue marks  sound is boxy i d recommend speakeramp and choose flat sound to get a clearer sound  but nothing is perfect of course and for that price this is a great investment,UK,0.92,positive
680,i just got my new macbook air and was super excited as it is my first ever mac computer  but it will not turn on  hopefully i will be able to return it  but either way it is going to be a hassle  a big reason i bought this was that i was tired of my windows laptop taking forever on windows updates and often being slow  but at least that thing can turn on very disappointed with this i thought one of the big selling points with mac products was that they  just work   when i first opened it after it arrived  it would not turn on  i figured ok  i thought they come with some battery life but i guess i have to charge it  it turned on once after charging it for a bit and then never again  after i went through the initial setup config i closed the laptop to let it finish charging  i came back an hour later and it would not turn on  i have tried charging it  i have tried plugging the charger into a different outlet  i have reseated the usb c cable and tried both ports  i have held down the power button for     seconds  i have tried hitting control   command   power  it doesn t do anything doesn t even make a boot up sound it just won t turn on  looks like i am going back to a windows laptop i have never had one that completely doesn t work at least ,UK,0.4448,positive
681,arrived quickly packed in harder than normal  fitted cardboard box   that was inside another box containing a coat we ordered   excellent packing   waited to unpack it until new cover screen   keyboard protectors arrived  this is the first mac i have bought online and the migration looked easy  but it hasn t worked  i ve taken down and since put back up  the firewalls on both new and old laptops  as advised  but  it never did migrate  but signing into everything apple was easy and i love having finger id   i m also looking forward to better battery life and appreciate a slightly larger screen  great discount  husband gave me a new ipad in september and i m anxious to see how i can use that as a secondary screen with macbook air ,UK,0.9779,positive
682,already had a brand new laptop windows  dealing with pop ups malware crap not to mention a big bulky laptop etc  wanted to get back in the game for quite some time  always wanted a mac air  best decision ever  incorporates well with all my apple products and just makes things a breeze with all it can do  the battery life is phenomenal along with the screen  don t get me wrong i was hung up on the high price tag  but i m so glad i pulled the trigger now ,UK,0.7649,positive

685,this is my first mac  it was not hard to get used to it as the laptop itself works great and has all the features needed  the battery life is extreme  way longer than i expected  it also charges real quick  nice that it uses a usb c plug to charge  it can be plugged in at any usb c plug  the only thing is that it only has two usb c ports  no sd or micro sd reader  i used an external seagate hard drive with my windows laptop and now use it with the mac  just had to download free software from seagate  the hard drive has   usb a ports that i can use to connect some of my devices that don t have a usb c plug  but this macbook air is super cool  the camera and microphone have great picture and sound quality  i have not even had a need to use my external blue mic yet ,UK,0.963,positive

687,i tried several other higher cost laptops  namely windows based   i was dissatisfied  display resolution was lacking  battery life  etc     looked at the new macbook air and purchased it   i am satisfied with it  no regrets     seems like it was created by people in the future    ,UK,0.0,negative
688,the media could not be loaded                          i absolutely love it  bought it because i m a math major in college and it s just what i needed  it charges fast and stays charged  i never shut my computer down but put it to sleep and battery is still good  i haven t used it to it s max ability so i m not sure      of what it can and can t do  it s light and is gorgeous ,UK,0.9049,positive
689,this is a replacement for my    year old macbook pro that still works but i m glad to have this new macbook pro air  it s battery life is far better that my old one and i am enjoying its much lighter weight  amazon s price was the best i could find and with my prime chase card i am buying it interest free ,UK,0.9845,positive
690,nowhere was it mentioned that this is the castrated   gpu core version  feeling deceived  in addition  the   gb ram      gb ssd version is nigh useless for anything beyond websurfing  having multiple apps open concurrently almost immediately yields the spinning beach ball of death  with a regular set of apps  like the ms office suite  the disk fills up in no time  now os updates are not working  since they require at least    gb disk space  but   battery life is out of this world  with the cpu temp sitting at   c ,UK,-0.5994,negative
691,i hate laptops  until i bought this one anyway  i probably burned through over a dozen  or so over the past decade  one of them was actually another mac air  i wasn t impressed  this      model however provides all the power and versatility that i ve only previously dreamed about   the retina display is gorgeous  clear and easy to read  this pc runs photoshop faster and cleaner than desktops that cost me       or more  music played back on this little laptop sounds better than any other i ve heard   the new apple m  chip really shines  beating the intel versions of this laptop hands down ,UK,0.8919,positive
692,i ve been using this computer for about   weeks now  hopefully i don t jinx myself by posting this review  but so far i ve not had any issues at all  the computer came in the original apple packaging and was ready to use within minutes  there is a noticeable difference in the ssd performance which now comes standard instead of the older hdd  load times are much faster and you don t get that clicking whirring sound you d get from an hdd  it s also incredibly light  so it s easy to take from room to room  great battery life as well  i don t plan to run any heavy programs like pro tools or final cut on it  but for web browsing  spreadsheets  and streaming movies it has been excellent ,UK,0.9804,positive
693,all forms of establishing this computer to the correct running system et al went smoothly except all the  passwords were defined in a not described format and the email program could not be connected as icloud had my email buried within the demographics it contained  it took two hours with apple to be able to send emails as the computer did not allow my google email to connect   however it is a very beautiful computer   wow   what a ride and an amazing thing to experience the apple representative and how he went thru each and every system   very interesting ,UK,0.9369,positive
694,this is a m  macbook air what more can we say   we went with used   good condition space gray in order to save money and so far everything looks and works well   there were   battery cycles  minor signs of use on the bottom  and the charger was obviously used but otherwise its in good shape   there were about   months of factory warranty left and i couldn t add applecare  since it was bought used so i went with a  rd party warranbty service instead ,UK,0.9001,positive
695,will not support apple s      thunderbolt     display  i have spent hundreds of dollars on connectors converters and dongles which do not work  both apple and amazon have sent me around    items that do not work  i have a tremor which makes it hard to work on a small screen   i was informed that each of the solutions would work by both companies and other third party sellers to whom they have directed me   shame on them  apple is not my friend ,UK,-0.5083,negative
696,the outward look of this mac air is not that different from my macbook pro that i bought in        with one exception  the new model has the m  chip and it never seams to heat up  the old model sizzled enough to brand your legs if you use it in laptop position no complaints on apple products  though  i can only hope this m  model lasts as long  it s a good bet because heat is one of the chief reasons for internal parts going bad  this is one cool computer ,UK,-0.0772,negative

700,i bought this laptop on sept     and received a defective one  on that date the item has been fully returnable  now amazon says that the item is not returnable  maybe they changed some policy after my purchase  that s it  in the item page we can see that    this item is non returnable  but if the item arrives damaged or defective  you may request a refund or replacement     my item is defective but even now they don t accept my return and don t give me a label to return it    amazon scamming people like you and me  so be carefull ,UK,-0.6024,negative
701,this mba is fan tas tic to use  it can run unplugged all day  the speaker is sufficiently loud  and the hi rez screen is eye popping but using a mac laptop s usb c port for power  after more than a decade of mag safe bliss  is darn near criminal  thankfully  we still have capitalism  and there are a number of  rd party workaround devices that mimic mag safe to a greater or lesser degree  sigh ,UK,0.9678,positive

703,apple makes the best computers   reliable  there are no viruses  and they have the amazing apple care support for all their computers   i also learned tat the only reason to purchase their separate apple care insurance is if you are concerned about the computer hardware  such as a broken screen   apple makes all your tech needs easier and is my first and only choice ,UK,0.9393,positive
704,great lightweight laptop  hard to get used to the new command keys if you are not an apple user already  great migration operation from other laptops even windows applications   not easy to fix or troubleshoot when necessary  had to get tech support to correct a bug with the m  chip hard drive   it was fixed but took an hour on the phone,UK,0.6425,positive
705,i had a mac air for the last   years worked very well   although a little slow on the upload download times but it was a rugged stout machine  the new one has already been repaired because of the track pad a a few keys sticking the track pad is awful as you can hover over it and it engages and sends without touching it and when you want to send it sometimes takes several clicks  changing the settings causes it to slow down and delay transmission and there isn t a happy medium   i have become used to it but when traveling in a car or plane it s obviously flawed  also upload   receiving times a mediocre at best score  i would pass till they work out the kinks in a couple of years ,UK,0.8909,positive
706,unexpectedly this turned out to be a espectacular laptop  yes  some applications are still not available natively for the m  chip but even through emulation they are very fast to use  camera despite having the same    p res it has a better image quality and i assume this is due to the chip processing image better than intel  for everyday use this is perfect for other tasks such as programming not yet ,UK,0.9393,positive
707,i owned a macbook pro in the past  this time around  there was no real selling point for the pro  so i got the    gb air  so that i get better storage as well as the   core gpu  the base only comes with a   core  i love this laptop  for light to medium gaming  media browsing and for productivity  this laptop hits it out of the park  stupid fast  great battery and a wonderful premium feel that no other laptop can match  this apple m  processor is a beast and should scare the heck out of intel  this baby plays minecraft and high settings with good frame rate  and pairs up amazingly with my other apple devices  apple is really pushing hard to bring a great product here  at a competitive price  in the thin and light laptop market  apple destroys the windows laptops in every way ,UK,0.9133,positive
708,i bought this because i ve historically had a good experience with the longevity of my last macbook air  i dislike the os  i hate the  magic  keyboard with the weird    key placement  i hate the  magic  trackpad and it s the biggest waste of money i ve spent  and most of all  i hate  numbers   both the software   also now the word itself  apple should  think differently  and stop causing problems when i m saving an excel file  deleting an entire day s work  which i don t think i ve experienced before so it was a weird   interesting feeling  if this thing doesn t retain it s longevity  i ll just eliminate apple from my life forever  the business cycle seems to be nearing edit  also for some reason  this thing just keeps restarting itself  the last few times i ve used excel  did i get a lemon  i m about to raise hell ,UK,-0.946,negative
709,this laptop actually lives up to all the hype about the m  chip and such  it is lightning fast  smooth  clear easy to read screen  and the battery lasts and lasts for all day and then some  also i have noticed that with any normal use it doesn t even get warm so the lack of a fan is not a detriment but nice as a nonexistent fan can t make any noise  i was slightly skeptical but as a multiple apple owner not surprised i was happy  seriously i just sent a   year old ipad that had been used hard daily for a battery replacement and received a brand new ipad   days after i sent it in  thats service as well ,UK,-0.6698,negative
710,no issues with this macbook  came in perfect condition  very easy to navigate  love the touch id  and the camera quality is okay  not as good as a phone  the battery lasts about an entire day  and the charger that comes with it is super high quality  buttons are very big and easy to see and push  the lighting on them is perfect  the touch pad being bigger is wonderful  very light and easy to handle  get as much storage as you can afford  able to do everything i need   more       recommend ,UK,0.9832,positive
711,i had a macbook pro           that machine lasted a long time and i love it  it dropped and i needed a replacement fast  macbook air      is not a disappointment  the battery life even if downloading is incredible  i had it downloading all night and i still have a charge  it was only a slow download because the internet speed sucks  the touch id is a delight  i love the picture quality  so far i am so impressed  hopefully it will last as much as the other lasted ,UK,0.966,positive

719,it s a mac  that s literally the only reason i bought it to customize an app that was ios compatible only  outside of that  the camera is horrendous  its giving very      photobooth camera quality  and if you have too many browsers or apps opens it practically crashes  not really worth the prices in my opinion  just pay the premium for a macbook pro if the camera and performance is a make or break for you ,UK,-0.5694,negative

731,pros  i love the new m  processor  i had an i  macbook air before this one that was fast  this one is to me compares to the i  for speed cons  i don t like that you have to buy an adapter to have a usb or to use my camera sd card  plus they took away the magnetic cord you charge with now it is just a plug in like the macbook pro  being a computer tech i see problems in the future with it being a plug  they always seem to loosen up as the years go on  other than that i love it ,UK,0.8934,positive
732,not much to say  excellent product overall  no cons except lack of ports  all day  battery life  excellent screen  keyboard is good as well  i have the   gb ram version but haven t seen any lag due to it  use it often to run demanding simulations and it has not disappointed me so far i was little concerned with the m  chip and compatibility  however  x      runs well enough  though cpu ram usage is a bit higher  dropbox  for example   if you are using native versions  its far better than any x      mobile cpus on market ,UK,0.853,positive
733,we own a macbook pro but needed a second laptop to keep the marriage from going off the tracks   bought the macbook air and are very pleased   it s lighter than our pro  has similar performance  is a bit lighter and cheaper   the only negative is that its two usbc ports are on one side  makes it trickier to keep it plugged in our seating situation   probably not an issue for most   oh  the battery life seems better than the pro   definitely recommend it ,UK,0.8334,positive
734,its cool  running zwift just fine after downloading rosetta  i push through an older    p projector and i have the apple adapter for hdmi  non  k   and its crisp enough for me at this point  opted for the rose gold and it really added a special tone to the notebook  im happy with it self updating too  the fingerprint button is a big easy too  i think i ll keep it ,UK,0.9132,positive
735,this product is not cheap  it s not something that you normally could just drop loads of money on    good job if you can take students perspective  not much to my name and obviously in desperate need of something that can at least operate  sure you can opt for something cheaper if you want something that just  works   however  if you want something that can get the job done  is reliable  absolutely beautiful  and long lasting that can beat any other laptop out of the park with the m  processor    i d suggest you get this laptop now stop thinking about it honestly  just do it  two days ago i was sitting here debating for so long if i should even go for it finally somehow having the funds  regretting doing so even after placing my order  all that went away when i held this near magical product in my hands for the first time  you will never have to buy another laptop again for a long time if you simply take care of it  it s going to take me a long way into my education    as will it you and what you chose to use it for happy m  ing be productive ,UK,0.9117,positive

737,this is a phenomenal laptop and not just at its price point  the m  chip is snappy and fast  the battery life is amazing and the screen quality is excellent  all of that is bundled in a thin  light and quiet  fan less  form factor  i d highly recommend this macbook air unless you want to run high intensity games  they just aren t native to mac os and won t run as well as they will on windows  ,UK,0.9565,positive
738,this purchase for me was an upgrade from a old macbook pro i ve been using for over   years got a refurbished macbook pro      for christmas   years ago so i when i saw the      macbook air new not refurbished for     bucks i jumped on it and i m glad i did because it s a great macbook fast efficient i edit videos for youtube everyday and this macbook does it way faster than my old slow macbook pro so i m very happy a must buy for sure,UK,0.9475,positive
739,i m not really a mac user  but i heard a lot of good stuffs on youtube about m  macbook air and want to give it a try  guess what  i don t think any windows laptop around this price range can beat this m  macbook air  no fan  so it is quiet yet there is almost no heat  battery life is insanely good  if you are looking for everyday laptop around          bucks  this is it  highly recommended  however  if you play games alot  especially windows games   then this is a no go ,UK,0.8569,positive
740,love everything about my new computer except the bezelless screen compared to my older macbook air   on old macbook air you could adjust screen angel by grabbing the metal around the screen with out touching screen  now with no bezel i leave fingerprints all along outer edge of screen  this is a minor inconveinence compared to the battery life and m  processor that walks circles around      macbook air ,UK,0.4215,positive

742,winner winner apple dinner   it is a gem   software setup cumbersome but once done   it kicks assthe trackpad lil stiff on clicking to select   guess breaking in will solve it   rosetta   had to be installed  so it can run intel based apps  if you get pop up    install it   had me goingbut for the money  it is fast  and installed new update   loads of preinstalled goodies   apple got this one right   the webcam they should have splurged on   they couponed out   but good enough    rd party apps will fix,UK,0.9246,positive
743,so my thoughts are on the m  air version and i must say its a great machine for the price it s my first apple device as i m a pc gamer but i had to have this because of the arm chipset being that it surpasses a lot of x   chipsets it s very impressive the battery life is by far the most impressive thing about it   nothing at the moment beats the battery life it s great it has a great ips display as well looks very vivid and sharp,UK,0.9822,positive
744,upon receiving my new mac  which i waited days for  i questioned the condition of the box   apple has very nice packaging but this looked beat up and worn   i did need to call technical support for something and found out by providing the serial number that my  new  mac air was already out of the    day warranty   i received a used computer   with the price i paid  this kinda makes my blood boil  this one is going back and i will get a new one in return ,UK,0.4672,positive
745,nice price bt pack had toxic black mold  not returning bc i couldn t smell anything on the hardware itself and i have stuff that needs to get done  advise looking somewhere other than amazon   if it looks too good to be true  it probably is  very disappointed ,UK,0.701,positive
746,i m a pc guy  not a apple fanboy  credit where is deserved though  apple does make nice if overpriced devices  it definitely has the best screen of any laptop i ve bought  the m  battery life and performance is quite impressive for a laptop for this size and price  keyboard is good too  points deducted for apple pulling it s usual crap     only   gigs of ram and     of storage  lack of ports too ,UK,0.8781,positive
747,what a great improvement over my old macbook pro  this is my third such computer  it keeps me in touch with the world and amazon  what bugs me is the razzle dazzle passwords i must come up with to access other sites which is why i use amazon almost exclusively there are so many goodies on this one that i will probably use only a few  though it is made for the new generation of users  great product  thanks applel,UK,0.9477,positive
748,i appreciate that the price was discounted for a great value   the package was secure and well packaged  which was very important  given that this was delivered via mail   no cracks on the screen   the processing speed is quick  which is extremely helpful   i appreciate there were instructions  in a small pamphlet  that explained how to transfer everything from your previous macbook to this macbook   a seamless transition is vital and means less frustration   this macbook air is very user friendly  especially visually   as someone who wears glasses  i appreciate the option to make the pointer larger  the ability to have more contrast  etc     that the user manual automatically pops up and walks you through enhancements and new features makes this even more user friendly ,UK,0.9816,positive

758,i m giving this a   star because the laptop is perfect for what it is and the seller was great  however i watched multiple youtube videos glorifying the m  chip as being fast enough that  gb could handle a ton of open applications  i need a bunch of tabs open for my work  use canva constantly  and occasionally need to open photoshop too so i needed to return this and buy   gb  but that s my fault and the youtube reviews faults  not the laptop  battery life is amaaaazing though ,UK,-0.2263,negative

1611,over the past    years  i ve had five macbook airs and three macbook pros  my employer provides a new one for my work every few years  and i upgrade my own at home every     years    most recently  my personal computer has been an early      intel quad core macbook pro and my work computer an early      macbook air   the brand new m  macbook air is my favorite by far  and fixes everything i didn t like about the macbook air   pro introduced in early      the m  mb air s battery life is amazing  i can use it all day and still have        battery remaining   my previous mb air and mb pro gave me around     hours of battery life  despite apple promising     hours    which was barely enough to get me through the day i m also loving the the fanless design  silent operation  and increased performance   even though i don t do much video editing  my workflow can be taxing on the computer   i regularly run lots of apps simultaneously  including zoom for teaching  many open browser windows  excel   statistical database software  and a connected ipad i use as a digital whiteboard when teaching over zoom   the new m  macbook air handles this easily  and does not get hot despite the lack of a fan   the mb pro i ve used since april  the one introduced in early      with intel quad core processors  also handles this load well  but it gets warmer and fans kick on sometimes   the early      macbook air buckled under this load  it gets very hot and the fans are screaming besides the better battery life  silent operation  and robust performance  the new m  mb air has a display with better colors and a slightly better webcam compared to previous mb airs the mb air s display doesn t get as bright as the mb pro s display   that has been true for years  but it has never been a problem for me   i would only need the display to be brighter if i were working outside on a sunny day  and i just don t do that i really love the keyboard on the new m  macbook air  which is the same as the keyboard on the early      mb air   pro  and much improved imho from the butterfly keyboards on the previous mb airs   pros   it is quiet and super comfortable for typing   when typing very fast  my accuracy is higher on this keyboard than on the butterfly style keyboards this is subjective  but i really prefer the mb air form factor   the wedge shape and slightly lower weight   compared to the mb pro   i also strongly dislike the mb pro s touch bar   i ve had two different mb pros with touch bars and they were nothing but trouble for me   when typing fast  my fingers would sometimes slightly graze the edge of the touch bar  which would trigger a command  like launching the music app   which would interrupt my workflow   i know other people don t have that problem  and other people find the touch bar useful  but it s just not for me for me  the mb air speakers  on this and on the previous model  are quite good for movies or youtube videos or zoom facetime calls   the microphone is perfectly satisfactory  though for zoom calls or when making my own instructional videos i usually plug in a cheap external mic which is a little better the webcam is still disappointing  even though image quality is slightly improved over previous macbooks the external design is exactly the same as macbook airs from years past   i like the design pretty well  but apple will redesign the mb air   pro in the next year or so to reduce the bezels which will allow a bigger screen without increasing the size of the computer   i will want one of those and might regret that i didn t wait but for now  the m  macbook air is the best macbook i ve ever had  it fixes everything that i didn t like about previous macbooks  except the webcam  and offers me a really great computing experience in just about every way ,UK,0.9989,positive
1612, heads up  this review will be lengthy  but i wanted to cover every aspect to make sure you make the right buying choice  the macbook air has always been known as a popular choice for college students over the years due to the lightweight  slim design and good battery life  one caveat that has always plagued the macbook air of year s past was underwhelming performance due to underclocked  lower powered processors  which were always reserved for the  pro  line   that was why i always got a macbook pro in year s past  this time around  when apple announced the new m  chip  i was curious  so i watched hours and hours of reviews and decided to pull the trigger on the new air  the air has the same chipset as the macbook pro  with the same ghz at      while saving        i am on a budget  but i also didn t want to sacrifice performance  so i was a little nervous i was missing out by not getting the pro  but thankfully i have not had to sacrifice a thing i am a full time digital design student  so my workflow can be demanding at times with running adobe photoshop and adobe indesign  etc  i previously purchased a      macbook pro and it was my daily driver until about mid march when i made a grievous error and went out and purchased a lenovo yoga c    with   gb of ram  intel i  processor at a whopping price tag of           buyer s remorse soon followed as the yoga was plagued with overheating issues  thermal throttling and absolutely horrific battery life  the only thing that i liked was the speaker set up and the  k touch screen  other than that  i was beyond disappointed  i sent it back  and went back to using my      macbook pro  until i purchased this air so the pro s fantastic battery life i have a tough time killing the battery on this computer  it will easily last an entire day  and even longer if you aren t totally hammering this thing with demanding apps like i do  it s great to know you don t have to always carry a charger with you everywhere  you can carry from class to class  the coffee shop and back home and it ll still have battery to spare   a win in my book heat management and fanless design i am super nit picky about heat management and fan noise when it comes to laptops  which is why i always love the macbooks and detest windows  hence sending the lenovo back    the fact that this computer is fanless and manages to stay cool to the touch boggles my mind  i don t have to worry about a computer than will get so hot that you can fry an egg on it  or annoying fans kicking on  i also like that i don t have to worry about blocking any ventilation grills  since there is no fan  i can sit in bed with covers under this and not worry i m blocking a fan exhaust   again  another win in my book slim design at     pounds  and having a tapered design  you can throw this thing in a backpack and not feel like you re lugging around a brick  i also liked the tapered design as it s a little more ergonomic than my macbook pro that has some really sharp edges by the trackpad  it s a nice change for someone that has to type up essays all of the time keyboard gone are the butterfly mechanisms of macbook s past  one thing i really missed when i gave up my      macbook pro was the keyboard  thankfully with the new air and pro s  you get the scissor switch mechanisms back  so my fingers don t feel like they re hitting bottom when typing for long periods of time trackpad i love  love the force touch trackpad  i still believe apple has one of the best trackpad designs of any laptop out there  hands down  it s smooth as butter performance this is the little machine that could  it puts my      pro to shame  it also outperforms the lenovo that was supposed to be top of the line  at a fraction of the cost  i can have multiple tabs in safari open  photoshop  apple music  microsoft word  and this doesn t even break a sweat  i also like that i can do some light video editing on this  for most people especially college students this computer s power should be more than sufficient  keep in mind if you are a professional videographer or photographer  you might want to opt for the pro as it does have a fan and can sustain heat management better in terms of thermal throttling  again  that s if you re editing like multiple  k videos on a daily basis  but for college students or the average joe that may only need to do the occasional video project no problem  this computer can handle it screen it s nice and bright  and the color accuracy is on point  which is important if you edit photos or videos in any capacity like i do speakers i am a music junkie  and i have to constantly have music going when i m working on school projects  and for such a thin and light laptop the speakers on this are actually pretty good  good stereo separation and punchy  they could do with a little more bass  and when you max the volume it can get a little faded  but that s to be expected for such small speaker drivers  i am more than pleased with them  they also work good for binge watching shows on netflix the cons  there are few  the webcam it s a    p webcam  and well  it looks like a    p webcam  it s a little grainy and washed out  it will do in a pinch  but you d think in      we d get an upgrade on the webcam the lack of ports in true apple fashion  the i o is somewhat lacking  you have   thunderbolt   ports  of which you cannot plug in an external gpu  and are limited to one external monitor  this is a limit that apple s m  system on a chip  not the thunderbolt ports  which i am sure will be resolved in future iterations   i would have liked to have seen at least one usb a port for legacy things like flash drives  etc  but that s just me being nit picky m  chip running intel apps because apple s m  chip runs on arm and most apps are coded for intel  there are many apps that have not been optimized to run the new apple chip natively  like adobe creative cloud   you might run into a few glitches and hick ups while app developers are getting up to speed  so far  i haven t really run into any issues  but there is that possibility  i am sure here soon it won t be a problem  again  it s nit picking   to sum up  this macbook air is a winner  i would absolutely not hesitate to recommend this to anyone  and i would absolutely buy it again  you get the performance and the portability  while saving some   by not buying the pro line  i am very happy with this computer and think i might just have come as close as i can to the perfect laptop for my needs happy shopping

1613,this was the first apple laptop i ve purchased  my entire life i was so excited to always purchase an apple macbook macbook air because of the positive reviews  i tend to review most everything in the most positive light  but this is just horrible  i constantly come back to the laptop and it says  please report unexpected shutdown to apple   this has happened at least   times with no response from an apple technician  then the camera quality for a      machine is something out of the     s  it s horrible  i look grainy and i bought this laptop for an mba program  if you want to run many programs at once  even with upgrade ram and processor  you will hear what sounds like an airplane trying to take off constantly  the  fan  does  not  shut  off  sure it s portable  sure the  build  quality feels good in the hand  in terms of performance  spend the extra money and don t get this  i m quite embarrassed i shelled out over   k for this  do as you wish  but this laptop is not worth the money and has pretty much ruined my desire to get any form of an apple laptop again ,UK,0.635,positive
1614,i love linux  i can tolerate windows  usually don t like mac  it s fine folks like what they like for me  linux gives the most choice is extensible  and runs so fast on even older hardware  you get infinite support you don t get harassed to use cortana  siri  candy crush itunes etc etc   mac usually they push you so hard in this echo system for a lot of stuff i really don t like  it used to be just getting music out of itunes was a pain well here we are in       i mainly work on linux these days  and wanted a unix style mac because working remote i just needed something with microsoft office  i need that  i am not doing windows development these days  i know there is wsl but there are trade offs on windows  not with mac     for my use case  so i tried it    gave it another shot really  my timing was seemingly really good  these computer are fantastic  you know what i hate about laptops  when they are     degrees melting your nuts and it sounds like you have a jet pack on  i hate that i really do  all of my laptops do this  the mac m  i am pleased to report doesn t  screw performance i mean that s great here  but the quiet and note heat that s the feature this is coming from someone that doesn t want to like apple  they outsource all these jobs  their stuff is over priced right  i m not so  sure about the price here  you can buy a mac pro    inch that s faster than an i  for       if you get   gb   and the battery is amazing  no heat  no fan  the sound is great  the screen is great  the keyboard is great  it s not a lenovo  but other than that it s about as good as you can get  this machine is so well thought out  i got the pro  the reason i take a lot of calls and wanted the slightly better sound  and boosted battery but if you don t need that you can just get the air which doesn t have the horrible touch bar  don t get me wrong  the touch bar would be fine in addition to normal keys  that s where they went wrong here they got greedy  i digress  the only other issue i see here is the connectivity sucks  it needs ports on both sides and at least  x ports all these reviews are usually full of crap  it s just people getting free hardware and writing reviews so they can take a tax deduction  or they are sort marketing  this time it s true  this architecture is a significant advance especially in the laptop space  i  m not sure if this will translate to a desktop   risc vs cisc isn t new it been going on for decades  but  for laptops  this is a quantum leap  i don t see any reason for the work i m doing to use a desktop computer a this point  i have complete portability  i can take calls  amazing calls   work on ms office  general development  vscode  all the jetbrains stuff  docker etc     i mean for a lot of system stuff i ll still use i d still use linux  but for work this is a great way to go  what a great product  it really really is  this i as strong of an endorsement i can give if you just need to be productive  after   months of hell no more fumbeling around with tpm chips  mics  no being able to share my screen  pleading with my computer to use the right audio device  i like it better than any other laptop i have ever had by far this thing is really just that good  i ve been i this industry for a long time  there are going to have to be some changes in competitors product lines  if apple continues to maintain this price point and deliver a product of this caliber  i have no question this one is going to eat market share fast  i d imagine there will be a strong response fro intel  amd and the software companies   it s difficult to justify purchasing any other laptop at this moment  i mean just get the air for       just get the extra ram  maybe     gb  that s all most people are going to need  who cares if they release better ones in   months  they always do they ll probably cost too much  this is all you need ,UK,0.9972,positive
1615,i have both an ipad and iphone so i thought is would be make sense to have a mac so everything is in one ecosystem  as it were   to some extent this has indeed proved true and useful   i am coming from a surface pro     the mac air s battery life is much less than advertised   the claim is around    hours  i doubt i get    and i am mostly doing internet browsing and word stuff   battery life from fully charged was about   hour while on zoom   the battery life of the surface is better   word for mac is a little different than word for a pc  but the differences are minor and manageable   but documents open more slowly on the mac  and mine has the m  chip   on the surface  documents usually open immediately   on the mac it might take   seconds  not an eternity  but a little annoying   the surface boots up much faster than the mac   i have a dvd with a number of workouts on it   i could not get any individual workouts to open using the mac s native software   so i downloaded vlc   it works fine on the mac  but takes a long time to open  about a minute   this seems to be true of any software not downloaded from the app store  including firefox   there do not appear to be mac apps for either   on the other hand  the mac has a better screen than the surface   while the surface is quite a good laptop  it is a marginal tablet  and i almost never use it as a tablet   when i am not sitting at a desk  i prefer the mac because the two parts cannot come apart as can happen on a surface   the new mac keyboard works great  maybe a tie with the surface   so a mixed bag   as i mentioned  i like having everything in one ecosystem  so likely that is enough of a benefit to keep the mac   i am mulling over upgrading to the macbook pro    because of its bigger battery  but don t know if i want to spend the extra money ,UK,0.9867,positive
1616,what happens when you perfect a product  you can only go downhill  in      apple perfected the macbook  then  they ruined it everyone in       it s great  a bit more battery life would be nice apple  we ll make it thinner  make the touchpad so big people hit it with their palms  remove the magnetic break a way power cable that everyone loves  replace all the ports with usb c ports so people have to buy dongles  swap the keyboard for one that barely even functions  and hell  just to mess with everyone  let s lower the battery life the      does little to fix any of the issues  it s a crap product  but after jobs died tim cook couldn t make changes because he d basically be admitting he was wrong  and they need to keep changing things because otherwise it is only perfect and not  new    whoever decided this was the way to go should be working in an amazon warehouse sorting returns ,UK,-0.1154,negative

1619,i am a life long fan of all things apple   that being said  after using this laptop for a little over a month  i am still impressed with how awesome this laptop is   the battery life alone leaves me in awe   i bought this laptop to use as an online student   starting with the battery fully charged  i am easily able to complete all of my online coursework and have plenty of battery power left to stream a movie or two afterwards   i actually purchased my macbook air m  laptop directly from apple so i would get the student discount   i did choose to upgrade my ram to the    gb for an additional       and that did cause delivery to take a little longer   totally worth it though   i have not done anything yet on this laptop to really stress test it  but i have had multiple webpages in the browser  and multiple documents open in word and pdf docs open with ibooks and preview   i have had no problems at all switching between open web sites  apps  or docs   the only time i started to notice any hint of a problem  it turns out it was because we lost power and therefore our home wifi was temporarily unavailable  so it had nothing to do with the laptop while it is a minor inconvenience that netflix is not available for download thru the app store at this time  oct        it is easy enough to access their streaming service thru the browser   the built in speakers are plenty loud enough  but it is quite easy to use your airpods if you prefer i highly recommend this macbook air m  to anyone  especially students  looking for a laptop that has a battery that will actually keep up with them all day long without constantly needing to find a power outlet ,UK,-0.0662,negative

1621,i gave my wife this new macbook air as a gift   months ago  she is very careful with it  she opens it last night and the screen is garbled  there s a hairline crack in it leading from the left edge  it wasn t dropped  it wasn t pressed on  sat on  or kept under books  in other words it was normal use when the damn thing stopped working we took it to apple store and they want       to fix it  it s   months old  the guy says the display is flimsy and subject to crack  i go online to see if he is telling the truth    found a lot of hits of others complaining about how easily the screen cracks i m a big apple fan but am disappointed and outraged that apple would sell a product with such a design flaw and expect users to  buy apple care  so that they pay  less when it breaks     even under normal use save your money  buy and older model or get an ipad which ironically can take a beating by a    year old gamer without fail ,UK,0.0839,positive
1622,if you purchase the macbook air with the m  chip you will no longer be able to run windows along with mac os   if your buying specifically to just use the mac os   don t have a problem not being able to run windows or any program that runs on windows  then this system is a good apple product   if you are like myself  or want the option like you should just have as has always been offered in the past with processors before the m  and run windows on a partitioned drive either with mac os  or boot up into windows instead  the m  chip now takes that ability to do so away   the macbook air itself with the m  chip now that they ve finally incorporated the ability to run iphone apps on it is in itself a huge breakthrough   that was overall my biggest frustration with using macbooks by a long shot   and it seems they ve fixed that now  so on one end impressive if your simply not needing windows or anything that runs in the windows environment of course ,UK,0.8555,positive

1624,i was hesitant to get a smaller macbook after my          macbook pro started to suffer from keyboard issues   i repaired the keyboard twice  so there must have been something wrong with voltage regulation to it anyhow  i couldn t resist the idea of an arm based macbook  so i went with the          macbook air since i don t think the pro model had apple silicon yet   i could be wrong on that long story short  it meets all my needs with flying colors   it turns out that i m perfectly comfortable with a     screen and that i don t need a bigger one everything great about this macbook   it s  fast    don t let the  air  moniker deceive you   unless you re into heavy gaming  this is the laptop for you   arm processors are the future of consumer computing   the battery life is  insane    i still can t comprehend how many hours this thing survives unplugged   i take it on flights across the country and never need to plug in or get worried that i will run out of power  even when i m charging my phone off it   it s slim and light   perfect for traveling   it is completely solid state with no moving parts   no fan whirring or anything like that   as an extension of the first point  it runs arm builds of windows insanely well with parallels   it can even run halo  ce at near full speed   macos is very stable   the retina screen is nice   despite what people are saying about the camera  it s actually better than the one on my old macbook pro    this isn t to say that the camera is  good   but it s adequate imo   all things considered  the m  macbook air is incredible value and really a great deal for the price   it has a larger touchpad than my old macbook pro but not quite as bit as the one on current     macbook pros   i find this preferable because it is just the right size where i m not constantly hitting it with my palm as i type   if you type a lot then the touchpad on this laptop will probably annoy you less while still having plenty of surface area   no touchbar     halleluja      decent sound from the speakers considering the size constraint there are some cons  but they are pretty minor imo   only the left side has usb c ports  in contrast to the pro which has them on both sides   the right side  does  have an analog audio jack  however  if that s useful to you   however  i ve managed fine without usb on the right side   it would be nice if i didn t have to click the fingerprint sensor button to get it to sense my finger and wake the system   on pros  the fingerprint sensor is always active   if you are one of the   people on the planet who want the touchbar  this will not have it   i however consider this a good thing   although the speakers have improved in quality since previous air models  the pro is still going to have better sounding speakers   you may feel like you ve gotten a bit of a downgrade in that regard if you are coming from a pro model   personally  i ve gotten used to it plus i use airpods most of the time anyway   the air does not have an hdmi port  but you can buy an  expensive  adapter that will provide hdmi   storage capacity is workable but limited   would be nice to get at least   tb of storage in the future   in the meantime i just back stuff up on to an external drive and periodically clear my downloads folder i m a software engineer and the m  macbook air exceeds my needs and expectations   i think i ll just be buying the air model in the future because it s terrific value for the price point        might be expensive for some  but i can assure you that it s a robust laptop so you are saving money in the long run   i ve owned many non apple laptops in the past and i ended up hating all of them   on the other hand  i never regret owning an apple device   this is coming from someone who formerly used windows and linux   i got tired of both the hardware and software breaking down quickly   apple isn t perfect    my last macbook pro chugged along for over   years until the keyboard repeatedly failed  but that still beats all previous laptops i owned that had numerous problems unrelated to how i treated them ,UK,0.9952,positive

1626,before i begin  i d like to clarify that i purchased this macbook on apple com i was kind of reluctant at first to purchase a macbook due to the expensive pricing  but it was heard that apple products are long lasting and really good quality  i ve had  chromebook for   years  and the quality is not amazing  i ve had to bring it for repair multiple times  it also shut down randomly  but not with this macbook the macbook is soo beautiful  and sleek  the rose gold color is so elegant  and the keys are amazing  at the top right hand corner there is a small button that enables touch id which is so convenient and easy to work by just saying  hey  siri  my automated assistant is summoned and will help me with whatever i need  it comes with so many apps  and so many ways to customize your macbook i changed my profile photo  set a quote on my lock screen  changed my wallpapers  made widgets  changed my highlight color  accent colors and much much more it s so convenient for me to have my zooms open in one browser and the  pages  app open in another so i can take notes while my teachers gives lessons as shown in the pictures  if you update your macbook with big sur  you can download  widgetsmith  and customize widgets  my entire macbook s aesthetic is so elegant and i just love it  comparing this to laptops like hp and dell  as well as google  there are limited ways you can customize your laptop to your liking i asked a couple of friends and family members who have macbooks  and they have had them for    years  without having to take their macbooks for repair  i am hoping this will be my case as well i can now message anyone from the messages app and the mail app the camera quality is great too  it s touched up my appearance with zoom and google meet  and i ve heard if you want a macbook to edit  the pro is the way to go because the storage is bigger the battery life is so great too  i ve used it for    hours starting at  am to      pm  it started at    percent and it only went down to      buying a macbook will not water your money  i am loving every second of my use    thank you apple     ,UK,0.9977,positive

1631,apple makes an incredible product  but their contempt for the customer knows no end  this is especially exemplified by the reduction of ports to only two on the macbook aires and even some powerbooks  and everything is put into those two  the separate power port is gone  the separate video out port is gone  in some cases  even the audio out port is gone  all they leave you with is two usb ports which they expect you to use for everything  for a lot of people  like myself  multiple ports are needed for constant use  they are needed for external hard drives  especially for file backup where you don t want to use the apple cloud which is susceptible to nsa snooping   external dvd and cd burners  special printers that do not work with bluetooth  special mice for people like myself with handicaps that make trackpads difficult  drawing pads  etc  etc  etc  and don t tell me to just get an external hub  i have tried them all and none of them provide proper power to external tools that need it  plus they frequently get hotter than a firecracker  in summation  apple needs to start giving consideration to the customer s needs and not just to some fancy  updated  technology  bluetooth does not work dependably and is a real pain most of the time and is not available for all external tools  we need physical ports  please put them back on the macbooks  especially the  aires   and stop taking them off of the mac cubes  the last one i bought had no audio port causing extreme problems with my video production work  please apple  bring back the ports  otherwise i may be forced  god forbid  to go back to microsoft computers ,UK,-0.8402,negative
1632,apple used to make great computers    past tense  i ve used them for many  almost     years but recently bought this computer in december and my sentiments about this brand has completely changed  how the mighty have fallen i was always the biggest apple supporter  i have purchased many as gifts for relatives as well as bought them for myself  from the apple watches to the screens and desktops to the macbook pros  macbook airs and phones  i defended them against the apple haters and always had their backs  i thought i was going to be apple for life  i even own many shares of their stock  which i will be dumping soon because i see the writing on the wall  i could tell something was up with them as apple continues to have great earnings reports but their stock doesn t move  it s the biggest slug of a stock  i now think i have stumbled upon the reason why if you google the recent complaints about apple you will see  apple does not have the great customer service they once had  i was mistaken to think they did  they have also started cheaping out    big time  the result  products that don t last  couple that with customer service that could give a flying eff if you remain a customer of theirs and i m sensing a recipe for disaster unfolding here    selling all of my  aapl stock asap stat warning  do not buy this computer  apple s quality has gone wayyy downhill the macbook air cords are absolutely horrendous  i am on my third apple cord in less than   months  i brought the product to an apple store and the employee denied that there was any problem with their cords and instead blamed me  he told me i must be doing something wrong  nothing has changed about my usage of their products  i ve always used them the same way and never had issues with my cords until the computer was really old  think years and years  not months  so you d think if i was the problem like this guy tried to say i was  i d be going through computer cords right and left  right  well i haven t  and looking up my account would prove that  however  apple doesn t care  they want to charge me for to replace their defective products anyway welcome to the new apple where the customer is always wrong then the guy doubled down and told me that he d been working at the apple store for    years and i m the only person who has ever had a problem with their cord  a simple google search has proved that to be completely false  everybody complains about the quality of their cords  this must be huge business for them selling cords like this so the employees gaslight you and will blame you if something goes wrong  if you want to sign on for that  good luck  i hope you never run into a problem and see what i m talking about but you ll be fooling yourself because it will only a matter of time  i am done  i work too hard for my money and they aren t the only computer show on the road  lucky for me i speak pc too thanks for nothing apple  good job burning that bridge  you just lost a loyal customer over      hope it was worth the extra       it s not the money apple  it s the principle  i won t do business with companies who treat me like that  period  peace out ,UK,0.8055,positive

1634,through the past year and a half  students have had to use personal computers and laptops for everyday tasks  most importantly being school  from my personal experience i believe that the macbook air      is the best tool for the job  if you plan to frequently use a personal computer or laptop in the future  the macbook air is the right choice because of its processing speed and storage  ability to keep a charge  and the apple compatibility that it uses first  the macbook air      is amazingly convenient to use throughout the day because of its ability to hold a charge and how quickly it gets charged  in my school days i did not have very much time to worry about the battery life of my computer  now i do not have to do that at all because i only need to charge my computer once to twice a week and its    hour charge  next  the apple compatibility that it uses  including apple music  imessage  facetime  etc   makes this product very easy to use while not having to use multiple devices to do actions such as getting a photo from your photos or getting that one picture from a text  this apple compatibility lets you see all of these things and not have to worry about changing devices to do so  finally  is the processing speed and storage  the macbook air      has a processor that is considered to be great for gaming and running large applications within the computer  this makes the computer amazingly fast while doing average school work and using it for everyday life  although it is expensive  the macbook air has been considered to be the best for its price out of all of the macbooks  including computers such as the macbook pro  the strange thing that the macbook has is amazing showing its slim appearance and lightweight feel  the storage that is available with the macbook is    gb     gb   tb  or  tb  but most went with    gb  these large amounts of storage are fantastic  showing that one of the macbook air s biggest competitors dell xps     only lets you choose between    gb and    gb  now if you want to have a large amount of pictures or apps on your computer that kind of storage just won t cut it  for these reasons the macbook air      is the best choice for daily use and school work because of its processing speed and storage  ability to keep a charge  and the apple compatibility overall  the mackbook air has the processing speed  storage capacity  battery life  and the apple compatibility to make it the best choice for a laptop or personal computer  throughout the last year and a half  i have had to be on my computer a lot to do school work and many other things  getting this computer has not only helped me do this quicker  but has improved the quality of my work because of its nice layout and convenience ,UK,0.9922,positive
1635,i m new to macbooks  having used windows my whole life  i chose this for going back to school because i knew it would last longer and not get buggy like windows always does  while the transition was a bit rocky at first  now that i somewhat know what i m doing  i absolutely love this computer  it s small and lightweight  but still feel solid in your hands  the processor is incredibly fast as well as the load up time  i can get signed in and have my notes up in seconds  literally  no joke    something i could never do with a windows laptop  i should mention that i bought my computer directly from apple and upgraded to the   bg ram and more storage  which helps immensely with load up time   for those that say the camera is bad  i don t think so  is it the most amazing camera ever  no  but if you really need higher camera quality for your job  then you should probably go with a macbook pro instead of air  for a zoom meeting it works just fine  the price is obviously higher than many laptops  that s why i ve never used mac until now  but just think of it as an investment  i know i ll be able to use this for years to come if you are looking for an efficient  reliable laptop with great performance  look no further ,UK,0.957,positive

1637,when i was in college  i used both mac and pc and after i graduated i switched exclusively to pc because of the versatility  gaming and upgradability   when i decided to go back to grad school  i decided to give apple another chance with this laptop because i heard great things and high expectation with the new m  chip design  i was not disappointed this new cpu has great speeds and this macbook air runs fantastic for daily moderate use  browsing the web  watching videos  reading  studying  etc     i can go to a cafe and use this laptop all day without having to charge it  also  it s so compact and thin that it s easy to take everywhere  compared to my old macbook from       it is incredibly light  i always had the notion that apple made heavy laptops  but this definitely is easy to carry around as someone who used a desktop  the keyboard was a bit harder to adapt to  the keys don t have a deep switch as a normal keyboard has  but considering the size of the laptop  it is expected  i can see it being an issue with its small screen  although it is convenient for me  the size can be inconvenient for those hard of sight  lastly  the price is steep for a laptop  a pc variant with this money can be used to buy a gaming laptop where apple normally lacks  but i have yet to try the apple arcade on my macbook air  it is also only usb c which is a turn off to many  but with a dongle  it is not a problem for me i would say if you are looking for a laptop to work or study with  this is an easy grab  make sure you buy a dongle along side of it tl drpros   battery life  m  chip  size  easy to carry around   weightcons   keyboard  size  screen is a bit small for some   price  only usb c,UK,0.9781,positive

1639,owned a      macbook air that had display issues from the get go  but apple said it might be okay if i was super careful handling it   i couldn t go without a laptop for   weeks so decided to risk it   after a couple yrs of being super careful the display became distorted after just a slight bump  and after the warranty period of course   used it hooked up to the tv only for about a year  but as that was difficult in itself  overheating  prevented sleep function  etc   had to change course   didn t wanna pay      for a new display  so   bought the m       macbook air instead  seemed to be operating well until   months in  when i wasn t even anywhere near it and the display went totally out   wouldn t turn on after repeated powering down so called apple   they had me power on with that shift control for    secs and it went on again  however  considering my experience with my last laptop took no chances and brought it in to apple they ran diagnostics and found that the ambient light sensor wasn t working   that s what automatically dims and brightens the screen when going into dark or bright places  in case you  like i  didn t really know what it did   had never dropped this or mishandled it in any way sent in my laptop for repair and it s now been more than a week without and they re still  diagnosing  it   luckily my old laptop is still semi functional if i hook it up to my tv   and i still had a few months left in the warranty   but what if it didn t and i didn t have the old one still functional two times in a row macbook air with serious display issues in the last   yrs  with no accidental damage from me  aside from this  has superior speed and processing power  doesn t overheat  but still takes       sec to power up and the touchpad functionality and the feel of both it and the keyboard are terrible when compared to the      i used to have if you buy an apple laptop now apple care plus is almost mandatory   will have to seriously consider going back to windows for my next laptop ,UK,0.9599,positive
1640,i absolutely love my new macbook   when it arrived i answered a few questions  connected it to my wifi and off i went   it has been a buttery smooth experience   keyboards are one of those things that are dependent on user preferences  but for me it s the best feeling keyboard i have ever owned   many professional reviewers agree it s terrific  the multi touch pad is brilliant  and now that i know the many different combinations of fingers and movements i zip around getting work done   for example a two finger swipe right goes back to the previous web page  no need to hit that back button   it is also custom configurable to your touchpad needs  what i appreciate most is the total cost of ownership value   i bought final cut pro x when it came out    years ago yet there was no charge to get the latest version downloaded from the app store  it does everything i need without an ongoing subscription fee like others have   i still can t get used to how fast it works  it took me an hour to render a video on my old mac but this macbook did it in just a few minutes   and it s cool and quiet  i m using a huge      k monitor as my secondary monitor   battery life is ridiculous   i plug it in every   or   days depending on my workload  which is several hours per day   i think the web camera is fine for me and many notebooks use this same    p size   i join one zoom conference per week  so it doesn t really matter  the one thing i hope gets updated with the next release are the ports   i m using a hub because it only has two thunderbolt ports  i recommend this notebook to all my friends and family ,UK,0.9928,positive
1641,i was using a      macbook pro for doing video editing for my church  and when i saw the specs on the m  based macbook pro  i upgraded for faster processing   my existing system has an apple monitor  wi fi keyboard and mouse  and a wd   tb external drive the two usb c ports on the new macbook pro are inadequate   i also bought a new     lg monitor because i couldn t figure out how to use the old monitor with the new computer   the lg monitor has   usb c ports on the back  so i assumed would give me enough connections for my devices   wrong     only one of the lg ports is lighting compatible  so i had to use it to connect and power the laptop   i had to buy a usb c to displayport adapter  plus a displayport to firewire adapter to connect my external drive  but this wasn t supported over the monitor s usb c ports  it had to be connected to the remaining lightening port on the laptop   this consumed all the easily accessible ports then i had to buy a usb c to usb  adapter to connect my camera and other devices to the computer   all behind the monitor   it s a royal pain   i ve got it working  but i m unhappy with the cludge   i don t understand why apple put together such a capable laptop with so limited connection capabilities   i m going to be d     g with this terrible configuration for years on the positive side  their claims of faster processing are true   i can put together a church video  then export it to a file in     the time as my old laptop   even the upload speeds to youtube seem to be faster ,UK,0.0453,negative

1645,okay  this is a great macbook  and a significant improvement over its predecessors  very fast laptop  as a student here are my pros and cons pros  portable for me to carry  i got a hard case for it and a sleeve and it is very portable at     battery life is fantastic  i literally charged it to     yesterday afternoon at     pm  now  as i write this review  it is still going  at      pm  with      in the past       hours  i ve been using photoshop and final cut pro  finishing my essay and facetiming a old friend  it is amazing m   the processor is super fast  even though this thing doesn t have a fan  it doesn t get hot at all  i have not seen this thing get warm a single time  the keyboard  let me put it this way  it is very satisfying  many people have many opinions about it  but i come from using a macbook      and asus vivobook  this keyboard is very good  has great travel and it isn t mushy  display is also very good  gets bright enough  even in direct sunlight and keyboard backlight is adjustable  something i haven t been able to do on my windows laptops cons  app support  plainly putting it  app support sucks other than applications that are optimized for the m   even as of       but my main apps work  like final cut pro  photoshop and lightroom  webcam sucks  it s still    p  and much worse than my asus  it s serviceable but not good ,UK,0.9909,positive
1646,first off i m giving this one star just so you ll read this honest review  i brought this mac book and have been satisfied with functionality and speed but i m giving   star because apple really nickel and dimes us as customers  the usb c cable that comes with the laptop is not even close to being one of the best on the market  i attempted to use it to power my elgato game capture card and the card would not read  kept saying i need a usb    to work  so i then used the cable that came with my samsung external hard drive and bang it work immediately  i spent a lot of money on this laptop just to receive a weak cable with it  the cable is literally only good for charging and light duty file transfer which i guess is ok for most people  but for me it was not  apple already doesn t give us headphones anymore and they don t even have the decency to give us a very good cable   star because for this price i could have built a computer or brought a prebuilt one  last apple laptop i will ever buy  o and the camera sucks and there are no setting to adjust it ,UK,0.9317,positive

1662,upgraded from mid      base macbook air  this thing is like    x faster  it is amazing  i got used to the usb c and bought a little hub that makes it a non issue  actually like it better since usb c is faster  battery life on my old macbook was amazing  this one is literally at least double that  pro tip do not use chrome on any mac or macbook it is energy and efficient and will kill your battery  took me a while to learn this   webcam is only bad part but all macbooks have substandard webcams compared to iphones  i got the base model and do not regret it one bet  i saved a ton of money on one less core and i do not notice a difference  heard its     or less   this thing is razor thin ,UK,0.9062,positive
1663,my      mba died  logic board    it was       years old   apple quoted      to repair it   the repair came with a    day warranty   they told me that if i had purchased apple care  it would have been covered   if i had purchased apple care on all of the apple computers i ve purchased over the past    years i could have bought     brand new macbook airs   used to be a fan of apple ,UK,0.6249,positive
1664,macbook review apple has created many technological wonders throughout the time of the business  and the mac is no exception  i have had different laptops before highschool  like chromebooks  so i knew what i liked and did not like  after about two months of searching  i landed on the macbook   when researching which laptop to buy for highschool  i landed upon the macbook for its reliable battery  the great software  and the modern features brought by the macbook  like touch i d  and siri  the modern aspects of the macbook are beyond great  and serve many purposes that other laptops fail to incorporate  the first one is fingerprint recognition  when i had old laptops  i always had to remember every character of the password  and it was just a plain hassle  now  however  apple has a fingerprint scanner built into the computer itself  which i find extremely useful  between my school passwords  my home passwords  and other important information  that is a lot to keep track of  now  though  all i need is my fingerprint and i can get into all of my accounts with my fingerprint  also  the macbook comes with siri  a virtual assistant to do tasks and find different files on the mac  there are many different papers  files  and websites needed to keep track of  and finding all those efficiently is almost impossible on your own  but  siri makes it easier  to activate siri  all you have to do is simply say  hey  siri  and the assistant will appear  siri responds to what is said  so if i say   hey siri  find  review    from google drive   the document will appear seconds later  although the modern technologies of the macbook are important  just as important is the software  many laptops lack the software that a high end desktop would have  but this does not apply to apple s macbook  first  the mac has capabilities that of gaming desktop computers  safari is the mac s main browser  so what happens if for some reason i need to use google chrome  well  the mac has the ability to run not only two but three different utilities at once  google chrome  safari  and bing  also  the software of the mac allows you to also play desktop games when you want to  most laptops are meant for business or school  like the macbook  but not all of them can perform as well as the mac for games  sometimes  after school  i explore and test the limits of my laptop just to get a sense for what the max is  i expected the macbook to do somewhat poorly  but i thought that it actually did pretty well  another reason why the macbook is great is because of the battery  the batteries for every computer seem the same  but once looked at in depth  not all batteries are equal  the macbook has a very long battery life compared to another laptop  like a chromebook  when i first used my macbook  i used it without charging it until it needed it  how long did it last after starting at      almost one day with no charge  the chromebook i had when i was in middle school would need to be charged after about five hours of use  also  the battery uses an optimizing system  when the battery is below      the system turns the battery power done  and thus turns down the brightness of the screen  this helps to maintain the battery for a longer period of time  not only is the battery great  but for many other reasons this is the best laptop i have had  the macbook is a modern  efficient laptop for not only students but for all kinds of people  from the battery life  to the software and the modern features  the macbook is a great laptop to use  no matter who you are and what you do  the mac will change not only how to get things done  but your view of a laptop forever ,UK,0.9973,positive

1667,theres a serious glitch where you can t use touch id if drained from dead battery  then it will ask you for a password  unclear if this is an apple id password or whatever  but mine didn t work  tried every combo i knew  and then there is no option for reset password  just none at all  and then it won t enter recovery mode  just a horrible product  stay far away,UK,-0.7615,negative
1668,the new macbook air with the m  chip is overall amazing  it s definitely worth the money  the all new chipset has turned the air lineup into a beast  my only complaint is the camera  apple has stuck to the same    p camera and claiming the neural engine makes it better  i m not convinced it s any better  and it s really a disappointment compared to other notebooks in its class  also  the inability to adjust the keyboard brightness from the keyboard  it s adjustable from the settings and easily accessible  but it s just an inconvenience  it s a petty complaint but for the money  this should be standard  it previously was on older models   aside from that  this notebook is amazing  lightning fast and the best battery life i ve ever seen  overall  if you re in the apple ecosystem and you re looking for an amazing laptop with all day battery life   this is the one for you ,UK,0.9346,positive
1669,buyer beware  like the macbook pro pictured here  the screen of the macbook air often cracks within a few weeks or months after purchase  entirely without any misuse  the design flaw seems to be the relative inflexibility of the screen s lcd panel i ordered a mba  then returned the package unopened after reading relevant articles on  to mac and the discussion thread on the apple support site  with few exceptions  apple refuses to make the repair under warranty  the user s cost of replacing the screen amounts to half the purchase price ,UK,0.6369,positive
1670,great out of the box  then slowly the battery life started decreasing  the constant hard reboots to get safari back up and running  inexplicably running hot  and crashing more often than a windows machine  simply plugging in the power adapter is enough to crash the system followed by the necessary reboot i firmly believe that apple will eventually get the bugs will get worked out  but for now look elsewhere or wait for either the m x or m  processors that will hopefully have this operating smoothly update  there are other emerging issues in safari  the keystrokes to italicize  command i  will randomly switch to opening up a new email message  and the keystrokes to convert text to latex   command shift l  now inexplicably opens the left panel  i am also coming into the known compatibility issue mentioned elsewhere ,UK,0.6187,positive
1671,i bought my macbook pro in      which makes it   years old  it s still going strong  i did have to replace the battery a few years back  i did it myself  bit of a pain as apple locks their stuff down pretty well  it looks like apple will drop support for this late      model next year  that s when i ll get a new one  not bad for close to    years for one machine  about a hundred bucks a year ,UK,0.882,positive

1675,this m  is such a leap ahead for apple  it has great battery life  no heat  and is fast and versatile  i  ordered the     model  but as a casual user  i don t know if i will ever use all that memory  i think that many people could order the     base model  and save some bucks  an external drive is cheaper than built in memory  the fingerprint sensor is wonderful ,UK,0.926,positive

1678,bought one directly from apple  i was excited to see how nice it would be to use since i had recently moved over to using an iphone and was impressed at how it had improved over the years  all the positive reviews and videos everywhere made this seem like a great product  don t be fooled  please  this is one of the most disappointing and frustrating pieces of tech i ve ever had the displeasure of getting to use  never have i seen or used a computer that had so many options that you will never need  missing options you should always have  and not be capable of preforming basic tasks without bugging out  to those saying this is one of the best computers you ve ever used  have you ever used a computer before  anytime within the last       years  i m willing to bet not ,UK,0.9555,positive
1679,just as i bought a  nd m  macbook air    the first one  which i m currently using to make this review  randomly freezes and then automatically reboots itself after seeing a pink screen  doing a quick search  you can find articles about this issue that isn t being fixed with software updates  this must be a hardware issue    god i hope they didn t cheap out again ,UK,0.5994,positive
1680,it s      and apple is still ripping it s customers off by only including   gb s of ram as the standard configuration   even worse is they rip you off again if you purchase this item with    gb s of ram  which is what it should have in the first place   and of course  there s not an option for a user upgrade   ridiculous for the price they charge for their laptops  ,UK,-0.6808,negative

1710,update          still going strong unreal has really smoothed out the bugs  this thing is an absolute beast  beats my old desktop easily i can run photoshop  unreal  lots of tabs in safari firefox  and background processes  all no issues  heck  i can even run a game with unreal engine going in the background  i ve rarely noticed slowdowns  and when i have it s always been a software issue  typically memory leaks  i ve abandoned windows    haven t loaded it outside of a vm more than a few times this year  don t hesitate to get this if you re looking for a new laptop update          well  i had some issues but i love this thing enough i m sticking with it i believe a  rd party usb hub killed the logic board and touch id for it  i had to wait about a month to go theough the motions  especially with the time of year  finally got my replacement back today and i m really happy unreal engine does not run well currently  it gets crashes and will freeze the computer  everything else runs super smoothly and i never have issues  really happy with the laptop initial post let me start this off by saying i was very skeptical  lifelong windows user  i ve only had an ipod touch        and very briefly an iphone    i think   i also have pretty demanding needs as far as day to day laptop use goes this thing has handled everything i ve thrown at it so far  the only drawback is that my current model only has  gb ram  but if you re conscious about what you have open it s not an issue  even with more intensive programs like photoshop or unreal engine    neither of which are even optimized for the platform yet  which as stated in the title  is really impressive gaming has been equally impressive  to be fair  i haven t thrown a next gen game at it yet  but i threw games that i thought would be able to max it out  nope  civ    borderlands    and oxygen not included all ran at ultra with fps staying at steady     in each game  even in more intensive portions of each game  i m not saying it ll be able to play every game at ultra  but it s definitely been able to handle more than i though it would  it almost seems to be outperforming my desktop  which has an i       and a    ti  i think it might if i had the extra gpu core and   gb ram  which is crazy for a laptop at this price overall  it s worth every penny  i could rant about all the small features that make the os amazing as well  but you can find videos of that online may already be familiar ,UK,0.9954,positive
1711,first let s start with the overall look of the macbook air  it s thin  sleek and super light   i got the gold color one and it took me a while to decide between the silver   gold  but after receiving my gold mac  i m so happy i went with it  the color looks so much better in person  it seems to have more of a rose gold color in person but if you take a picture of it  it looks gold i use my mac for some web searching  emails   when i do so the battery does good  and if i m doing some photo editing and downloads it dies faster  i spent all day on it and it does not get hot  so that s a plus  i don t feel like i have to give it a break i got the standard memory and just got a hard drive to upload my photos on there   if needed now the camera  it s terrible lol but that doesn t bother me much because i won t be using or doing any zoom calls  but i wish apple would make it better since it s not a cheap lap top i also came from not having a lap top  so far is perfect for me and what i use it for  i love that apple connects everything for you and it makes it that much easier to see emails  txt   calendar etc      i also love the vibrant color and sharpest of the screen ,UK,0.9955,positive
1712,the first one i received got bricked trying to restore after the initial setup failed the second one is fine you can google the issues apple support said i d need to bring the first one into the apple store for a firmware update to get it working not great for a brand new       laptop anyway the second one came already updated and everything has been fine so i m happy now it s snappy and has that new macbook smell ,UK,0.6856,positive
1713,no problems with the mac air  easy to transition from my old      macbook pro  i also bought an external hd which was cheaper than upgrading from old     to      my warning is about office       there was stuff on the web that      would not work  needed   bit  but while there seemed to be workarounds  i just upgraded and bought       there is a scam site posing as microsoft office setup that looks legit once on it  but you get an error message and phone number to resolve  after half an hour he explains that it is the firewall and can fix it by downloading one costing only hundreds of dollars  the url isn t microsoft but rest looks like it  while i didn t fall for it  it is preying on the few who might  so thought i would mention it  the mac is good and worth upgrading especially if  as with mine  hardware faults are developing in old one ,UK,-0.3919,negative

1715,this laptop is very good for students and people wanting to do basic work as well as people who are going to have this laptop under extreme loads  i ve ran heavy games and video editors and its done amazing  it s even beat some of my other        macbooks  it s very light weight       pounds   and is very thin but yet durable  it doesn t feel cheap like some laptops at this price point  it feels very premium with the metal body and soft keys and the retina display  the track pad is very large for the size of this laptop  i also love how it s fan less so it never makes any noise which is another reason why it s good for students    video calls  etc    my one and only complaint is the camera quality  it looks nice if you have good lighting but if you re in bad lighting it looks like a potato filming  but if you can get passed that it s great  i also love how the keyboard is backlit  it helps a lot if you re in a dark environment  the screen is also very good  it s nice and bright and has amazing colors which is very good for photo editing  the package even came several days early and shipped very fast  although the costumer service isn t very good  they didn t answer the questions i messages them about    i ll try to answer some questions i had   it does come sealed in the original apple packaging and it does have the m  chip  all around i highly recommend this  it s amazing for the price tag ,UK,0.9978,positive

1719,it s a great computer   is stupidly fast   the battery last for    to    hrs on constant use   if you don t use it that much last for days without recharge   it behaves like a smartphone but just bigger to fit a full keyboard and a big screen  with the same or better performance   this is the new era of laptops and desktops  you ll see soon other brands doing it too   because it uses  no fan at all   is very thin and lightweight   i don t need to use an egg carton on my lap to avoid overheating like the fan ones  the m  ship is definitely a great upgrade   excellent idea   ,UK,0.9821,positive
1720,i love everything apple did to update the air  it s  by far  the best laptop you can buy right now  that s especially true if you were a mac user before  i wasn t  so i had to learn where everything was and what not  but it didn t take to long the battery life is phenomenal and i have had   issues with the thermals  when apple said it would cool passively  they weren t lying  i ve had     programs running simultaneously and it was obviously warmer  but nothing compared to any other laptop i ve used  the fact that it s dead silent when running is a nice perk as well i like how they kept a lot of the tried and true design on the outside because i don t think many people saw anything wrong with it to begin with the screen has amazing clarity and  in true apple fashion  all of my apple devices connect seamlessly absolutely the best laptop one can buy right now ,UK,0.9812,positive
1721,zoom calls perfect and beautiful  video quality is excellent   performance is amazing   running parallels and windows    preview  screen looks beautiful   movies look amazing   audio is loud and sounds spacial   battery lasts easily all day and sometimes two days blows away my      macbook air   blows away my      macbook pro   don t miss the touch bar ports are enough   but wish there was one on each side as perfect a laptop i have owned and this m  macbook air run windows     i use parallels and windows runs super fast and looks amazing   no impacts to battery life   i saw some reviewers say it won t run windows and this is not true ,UK,0.9874,positive

1726,i ordered the space gray version and it s beautiful  i ve owned an older version of macbook air and this one is def faster  not really sure if m  has something to do with it or maybe because it s fairly new lol whether or not it s fast  i m still keeping it  if i kept the old one for   years  this version will be just fine  i m sure it s faster and better altogether ,UK,0.7931,positive
1727,i ve owned my fair share of laptops and let me tell you   nothing even comes close to this  spectacular battery life  incredible display  tactile keyboard and haptic track pad with all its  gestures and features which makes multitasking a wonderful experience  to top it all off  big sur  os  wraps it all up and makes your workflow the greatest pleasure  only thing i would change is the camera  it is decent in a well lit environment but struggles in the dark  putting a bigger sensor is a hardware limitation and i understand that  having a display this thin comes with its  sacrifices  if i could give this laptop    stars i would  don t hesitate on purchasing it  you won t regret it ,UK,0.4854,positive
1728,i love the battery life  it lasts so long that i charge it sparingly  i love the instant on feature when i lift the lid  i am impressed with the biometric scanner that allows me to log in without my password  the macbook air allows me to log in with my apple watch as well  the speed is fantastic  i am thoroughly impressed  i have an m  mac mini as well  i am hooked ,UK,0.9698,positive

1732,still learning some of the new features  not sure if i like it better than the macbook pro  it is slow to come on at times and sometimes has to be fiddled with to get it to come on  screen quality is good and speed is improved  touch sensitive keys are taking some getting used to ,UK,0.703,positive

1736,an excellent option  for work  have some problem with docker    for developers guys  the rest all very well  the screen  and the sound  and options are good  we only recommend a base for macbook  for some heat in the down of the laptop  but i think is because don t have forced ventilation for the processor ,UK,-0.0267,negative

1787,after years of using nothing but pc laptops  the m  chip compelled me to try macs  and let me tell you  the hype is justified  the new silicon macbooks are simply incredible  the arm based silicon chip is so amazing that i was able to forgive the laptop for its downsides  which are the    p webcam  lack of sd card slot  and not being able to upgrade ram or ssd  despite these drawbacks  the battery life is insane and the machine is completely silent because no fan is needed since the laptop is so heat efficient  you re also getting a powerful laptop that outperforms the vast majority of windows laptops in the market  to top it off  you get a touchpad that puts other laptops to shame  a beautiful aluminum design  and build quality that will last  well done apple ,UK,0.9699,positive

1904,the new m  macbook no doubt pushes processor technology further with apples own  arm  processor    and it seems pretty zippy  but      if you run any older software which you need to run your business  like adobe suite for example  then forget it  it uses wine  native emulation  to run non m  streamlined software and quite frankly  its a bag of  insert swear word of choice   photoshop specifically is juddery and completely unstable with the m  i bought my mbp at the start of the year and quickly realised it wasn t great for my most used applications  but  i held out for adobe to update     when they released a patch to get you by  it helped  but it still ran far smoother on my old i  windows pcapple have always been a bit behind their windows counterpart for internals   and this was their shot to get ahead  but they should have had all the  rd party software houses on board before release  not after thankfully amazon have a generous return window which enabled me to really try this thing out  but it affects my productivity to the point where i just dont want to use it on the plus side  it boots quick  it loads optimised apps quick ish  not instantly like some would have you believe   fcp seems ok  but again  not as snappy as some make out and as always with apple  it looks good    but its simply not ready  or rather software companies arent ready to push you decent running apps ,UK,0.9462,positive

1993,i purchased the new macbook air as my old macbook pro circa      will not update and is running slow as well as out of storage  i was nip and tuck about upgrading but saw all the amazing reviews on the new model so it seemed as if there was a time to upgrade it was now  big mistake  from the moment i purchased at christmas it has been nothing but one ridiculous little problem after another  things you wouldn t imagine    straight away it didn t feel great but i said i would keep giving it a chance  but first impressions are everything with things like this really first of all apple make it fairly awkward moving stuff from one mac to another as it seems you can either move it all or nothing at all  this is a big problem considering the storage on this model is alot less than my old one which is even full  so into  rd party programs you will have to go of course with apple these days connections are getting less and less  here we have no direct root to even connect your iphone  so more things you will need to buy  also not even a power button so every time you open the lid it turns on auto which can be a nuisance one of the main problems i find with this pathetic laptop is you will very quickly find yourself getting a message regularly telling you your mac is using alot of memory  not to be confused with storage  this is something i was never even aware of on previous laptops  but now on a brand spanking new one i am already getting it and its not that all memory is being used as its not  its just when running particular sites e g facebook they seem to use lots of memory in the one go  so this slows down this so called super quick mac  which it is not  it is slower than my old macbook air was when i bought it and so weak it cant run basic operations any quicker than a cheap laptop what next    apps like iphoto can be touch and go with recognising your devices  no backlight apple logo on the mac no discdrive  i can go on and on here  all the things that made a mac the thing to have are gone  this is now a cheaply made barely worth having device  i can only assume all the reviews are fake or people are easily pleased spending so much money on a weak product  i have always been an apple fan too  but between this and the terrible apple watch especially for training  which i will get to in another review  i am really losing faith in this companys product quality  one thing i will say which might surprise you is the customer service from apple i found to be pretty helpful  trying to get my music on old mac to even play on new mac cause of authorisation problems  of course i had to ring with the amount of problems with this but you just keep running into more  i am sure i have left out alot but the problems really are endless  keep tour old one if you can ,UK,0.9156,positive

2027,i find my macbook air      nice to use  the screen is clear and the keyboard and track pad good  and it is good for regular tasks  the webcam is of dismal quality however the spec was good but the real issue i have is with temperature and fan noise  the machine rapidly overheats and the fan kicks in on even on a regular hd video such as one you would find on youtube the issue has been widley commented on  eg       macbook air issues  overheating  noisy fan   ineffective cooling   so i don t understand so many postive reviews here on amazon maybe there is a something i am unaware of but my software is certainly up to date i have an app called turbo boost switcher that will disable this feature which helps greatly but is still inconveneient to use and really i would not expect to have to take such remedial action at all on a computer at this price range ,UK,0.9638,positive

2033,i got my new macbook pro m  two weeks ago and could not be more happy with it  this machine is absolutely incredible in terms of speed  looks  weight size  display  and battery life   and texture  it feels so good against the skin on my wrists as i type  and basically anything else you can think of  i also love the space gray color  the new keyboard  the touch bar  and the larger trackpad  there are so many options to customize the system to work just the way i like my previous macbook was the      model and it still works today  but after    years it became too slow and the trackpad had trouble clicking  so after a ton of research  i decided to pull the trigger and get the new macbook pro with the m  chip a couple suggestions i am able to give after spending almost two months and probably over    hours researching the new macbook are  go with the standard model of  gb of ram and the     ssd   you can get this on amazon for       vs       at apple   so you get to save    bucks  and you have the added satisfaction of not having to deal with the snobby nerd losers that work in the apple store  who asked me rudely when i went in to get a new laptop  umm  do you have an appointment  well  you re going to have to make an appointment if you want to go in the store   i love apple products and will never use another phone or computer besides the iphone and macbook  but after that experience i will never again give my business to the physical apple stores  i mean  seriously  do you really need me to make an appointment to buy a       laptop  whatever dude anyway  in several youtube videos that compared the  gb ram model along side the   gb ram model  costs     bucks more   the  gb performed just as well in nearly every task   and they really pushed it to the limits  the only reason to pay up for the   gb ram is if you want to edit  k uhd videos or are a super serious music recording artist or highly advanced professional photographer   and even then it s not too much of a difference  for the every day user  me or basically anyone who is not a computer professional  the  gb working with this new m  chip is mind blowing  blows any other laptop on the market completely out of the water  and actually even performs just as well as the          inch macbook pro using the intel chip  as far as the storage goes      ssd is standard   that s what i got   and you can pay     bucks more for     ssd or     bucks more for   tb  but with the cloud storage available now  you don t really need to keep much on the laptop drive  you can just save it to the cloud overall i honestly could go on for hours about every little detail that i absolutely love about this machine  a free one year subscription to apple tv is also another little perk  but i am still mystified every day at how incredible this machine is  i ve been online for over   hours now and its still on     battery  the new retina display is brilliant  everything is perfect  i truly am in love this laptop and would recommend that anyone looking for a new laptop to last a long time and outperform everything else on the market gets the new matchbook    inch m  ,US,0.996,positive

2038,i m going to preface this review with the   thing i dislike so we can get that out of the way i mean let s be honest  that s what most people are looking for when buying a product the down sides it has a standard    mm headphone jack even though apple quit using that on it s handheld products years ago not that i care  it s good that they include the    mm jack but how come they didn t include one for their lightning connector that their headphones come in out of the box  forces you to either change to a standard headphone jack or bt headphones  probably trying to push their airpods line  other than that  i have no issues  it s fast  efficient  reliable and easy to use  if your familiar with ios on these then it ll be a great addition to the tech team you have at home ,US,0.9167,positive

2040,the battery lasts forever and its fast  my last macbook had a pretty good battery and worked very well for years too the m  does allow for dual external monitors and there are two usbc ports total  these two things can be worked around with dongles and a video hub but now i have      worth of accessories and a tangled mess on my desk how is a      mac not compatible with dual monitors but my      hp works great with the same monitor setup    i really can t get past that get the intel version with   usb ports and you can use it in your covid home office out of the box ,US,0.8734,positive

2042,i really wanted to love this laptop  i ve had only macs for years  this was supposed to be an upgrade from my      macbook air  i previously had a          intel based macbook pro for work configured with two hp monitors  no issues with the monitors and connected instantly with zero effort to get the screens to work with the laptop  bought this one and connected to my belkin hub for the hdmis  would only connect a single monitor  googled the issue and found that the new m  apple chip only supports a single monitor  news to me and i guess i should have researched more  however the low rating stems from the fact that this is a pro laptop  a professional would want two monitors and should not have to google whether a pro laptop supports more than   monitor when the intel version does seamlessly  despite this i had planned to keep it and just deal with   monitor because of the cost savings over buying the intel based macbook pro and wanted the longer battery life  now brings me to the issue that made me return the laptop  this laptop just would not configure to show a clear resolution with my monitors  the scale was off and the display just stayed blurry no matter what setting i changed it to on the monitor or the laptop s settings  tried and tried and just gave up  returned this and ordered an intel based     macbook pro  no issues  supports dual monitors  and seamlessly integrated to the laptop  no blurry screen and no having to set or change any settings to get it to work  i am floored that apple would produce a pro for business that only supports a single monitor  i love apple but will not buy anything with their chip until the kinks are worked out ,US,0.6577,positive
2043,i am an apple guy  i converted from pc        and have loved every apple device until the iphone x and the new macbook with m  chip  where to start  first  as is a major complaint for everyone  the macbook pro has all of two ports  yes yes  i know  this was listed in the specs  it doesn t make it ok   if i need to be plugged in  i have   port remaining  it is incredibly idiotic that i have to buy a dock to expand my ports  oh and the ports are only thunderbolt in apple s continuing stupidity of forcing the market to adopt its garbage  i did not buy a mac air for a reason  yet the macbook pro comes with all the limitations of an air  the new charging cable lacking magnetic attachment makes zero sense  the track pad is beyond finicky to the point of being useless  i have no bluetooth connectivity  i get incessant windows telling me to log into podcasts or apple music  i see zero performance improvements with the m chip  in fact  doing a side by side video recording with quicktime  all parameters equalized  i have a severe lag with m  mac  but not with the intel driven machine  and the touch bar is about the worst idea ever  i constantly dim the back light  or go back on web pages because of it  absolute trash  i bought this computer for work and will be designating it as a laptop for our interns  because that s how terrible it is  i will not be duped into replacing this hunk of garbage with the forthcoming macbook pro in which the port and charging issues have been fixed so now begins the massive switching costs for foolishly demonstrating brand loyalty to a company who has none for its customers ,US,-0.7749,negative

2050,coming from years and years of pc  i must say that this     m  macbook pro is an internet beast  i also use it for lightroom  photoshop  affinity suite  capture one  fl studio and i have zero complaints  i hadn t had a mac since the mid    s and i was a huge fan then  but pc s just offer so much more for the money the ports are an issue and you will need to buy a dock like device because you ll need it to hookup older devices or more than two devices at some point get the   gb model   while i have no issues with ram so far  i believe the   gb model should be the base model because the hibernation sleep is going to kill the nand hard drive eventually from writing to disk every time you close the lid there is an issue with the keyboard that i haven t been able to replicate  but the delete key will enter a state where it doesn t work  though the keyboard still functions  i have to close whatever window i m typing in in order to get the delete key working again  it s not random  but i haven t figured out what two key combo is causing the problem or if it s just in twitter the screen is      accurate  close enough  out of the box   the reason i got the macbook pro is because of the issues i was having with my     dell xps  which is a beast  color discrepancy when exporting  the colors were always over saturated and i had to guess what settings to use to counter the output  i did everything imaginable and always color calibrate with spyder  for    years i ve done this  but the accuracy was never the same on other screens  printing or web postings i never used the touch screen on the xps  i hate smudged screens the battery life is insane  as you ve probably heard    days  all day  no issues surfing the web at whatever levels are auto adjusted for on battery usage the touchpad   while really good  there are times when the two finger scrolling skips around  but overall  is a good experience i m not a fan of the operating system at all  just like ios  it s just too clunky and cluttered  something odd coming from a company who builds incredible hardware with fantastic esthetic designs ,US,-0.6674,negative

2052,i finally  after years of my artist friends and colleagues using apple product  laptops  macbooks  desktops  i decided i d get one as i needed a new laptop since my previous one was    years old  at first  i was just sad for having spent so much  i thought  this better convince me otherwise   after having this for two months  i can say i hate it don t get me wrong  there s some decent features that add convenience  but i struggle to complete work in a timely manner as i have to constantly save or redo lost work  the macbook can t consistently run  for example  adobe indesign  adobe illustrator  and one google page  i know you re probably thinking  maybe her file size of the projects she s working on are bogging down a successful running speed and responsiveness   that is not the case the work i am creating at this moment in time is basic web design  typographic studies of minor levels of file work  and an occasional image that needs photoshopped all in all  this product is a bit expensive for my liking  it s got many decent aspects  such as a finger id to unlock easily and touchscreen bar along the top of the keyboard display  cool  but not worth         after tax  if it is going to prohibit my work in graphic design ,US,0.9476,positive
2053,it s a macbook pro bro  what s there not to like  it s been  yrs since my      macbook pro purchase and i still use it  i just have to keep it plugged in because i can t find a good battery replacement for it  this m  is much thinner    i would say half as thin as the    retina model battery life seems good but it was good on my last one  i can use it all day  button press trackpad even the touchbar is good  i do not understand the complaints about the touchbar  i find it kinda cool and ok  maybe my opinion will change after some use the speed is what everyone raves about  i don t see it  it may be slightly faster but it s hard to tell just how much faster  when i open or load it doesn t seem super fast as everyone claims  i m sure it s faster but it s not like its drastically noticeable i had one issue initially  i set up my fingerprint id and all was fine until one day it didn t work and it asked me for my password  i could not remember my password and it took a whole day to figure out how to reset it  so far it s only happened once and i hope it doesn t happen again because using the fingerprint scanner i forgot my password already  the audio is good  definitely not tinny or hollow its that good quality audio you expect  good full sound  volume is ok too could maybe be a little louder i do not like that it has no ports  just   usb c slots    you will have to buy an adapter  at least they kept the headphone jack  i also do not like clicking to drag n drop  i don t see any settings that i can change for this  i like being able to tap and   finger drag i was expecting this to be really fast because that s what they were bragging about but for the money i maybe should have got the air with more gb  but the camera and sound is better on this one  the screen doesn t look as hd as the retina model seems a little flat but it s good  overall you know the quality of apple  i will most likely always have a macbook pro    ,US,0.9899,positive

2055,i am a long time windows user  i ve had so many different windows laptops  each with their own faults  i ve always despised macbooks because of what you hear from every person who s built a pc before   apple makes crappy products    no good to use       ever since i got my ipad pro a few years back  apple has slowly dragged me back into the ecosystem by how good their products have become  with the release of the m  macs  i was pretty interested in how well these will perform  and eventually caved and bought this macbook pro i was wrong  i ve been wrong  this macbook pro has very good performance and has kicked ass through everything i throw at it  i like the big sur operating system  everything has been made super easy  and also connects to all of my other apple devices  being able to to text people from my macbook is awesome  my only complaint is honestly  like everyone else  the touch bar  i wish i had the regular function keys like on the air  i got this one because of better battery life  and man  this laptop lasts me a week  what     my ol reliable acer laptop only lasted me   hours  and i thought that was good sorry windows fanboys  sorry pc master race  for laptops  i will never replace my home windows desktop   the macbook is one of the best devices you can buy  it s great ,US,0.9828,positive

2057,my laptop lasted less than   months before it died  i talked to an amazon rep who was responsive and put me in touch with an apple rep  who was curt  he suggested bringing it to a local shop licensed by apple to diagnose and repair  but he said they didn t have an appointment for almost a week  at the shop  they were much more responsive but warned that a small crack in the bottom of the screen that happened when i close it one day likely caused the problem  would not be covered by the warranty and would cost      to fix   fingers crossed it is something else  but he said he was    percent sure this would be the case   two issues with my      apple macbook pro with apple m  chip     inch   gb ram     gb ssd storage      debris can fall into the seam between the keyboard and screen unseen and    i kept having to adjust the brightness  even though i set the screen to be bright  it kept returning to dim  my other complaint is that the apple rep was curt  the tech at the shop said he sees a lot of screen issues and highly recommended by the warranty plus plan  which costs over       for two years  i think  and then      year ,US,0.7575,positive
2058,i left my brand new m  macbook pro in my car for an hour and now the screen looks like a picasso painting   both amazon and apple refuse to pay for repairs because apparently this is considered an accident rather than a manufacturer s defect  even though i bought it only two months ago   so i m out      to repair a two month old computer   i would heavily advise against buying one of these  because if this is considered normal rather than a manufacturer s defect  then    degree heat is enough to damage the screen   this means that they re essentially useless if your air conditioner goes out and you will be left with a repair bill that is half the value of the computer ,US,-0.872,negative

2064,i ve been an apple user for over    years  and i was pretty excited to make the m  migration now that many apps have been updated for apple silicon  i expected to be blown away  and while this is an excellent apple laptop  and the battery life does live up to the hype  i overall i found it disappointing compared to the reviews  three things    sure  it may fly if you re doing really cpu heavy things  but for things like  heavy  productivity  i found it no better than my intel      in fact       this could be related to all the stories i read saying    gb on apple silicon is like   gb on intel    yeah  don t believe those  again  this may be true for tasks that are well suited for arm  but heavy productivity work is no better  i keep a decent but not insane amount of safari tabs open at any time  and that plus having much of anything else open kept the memory pressure graph constantly in the yellow  if not red  and that may or may not be related to the biggest problem which is       i had significant problems using my lg  k display which has worked like a champ with my      sometimes it would take up to   minutes before things  settled down  and i was actually able to use the computer again  that was a dealbreaker would   and   have been better with more memory  or are these m  growing pains  or something else  i don t know  i ll probably give the     a try with   gb whenever it comes out  for now  this     was just too underpowered for my fairly average professional needs i realize that reviews below   stars on this are rare  which i find puzzling for the reasons above  hope this is helpful to anyone who might be wondering about the downsides ,US,0.9848,positive
2065,i got this for        which it s       if you buy it from apple  which makes no sense   it was either this or the macbook air for       which is      at apple    i got this because i ve had many macbook airs and wanted something different   if i had to do it again  and wanted to save money i would have gotten the air   the difference is this has a fan  a touch bar  a better gpu  and a brighter screen for      more   i was worried because some people don t like the touch bar but i think it s great   and besides  you can even set the touch bar up so it s just like the old function keys you re used to  but as touch keys there really is no competition for a macbook   i ve tried them all  the dells  the surfacebooks  etc  and they re never as good as an apple macbook ,US,0.8361,positive
2066,i was excited to get the new macbook pro m  as reviews described it as a very fast powerhouse computer  my first impression was strong  i started to play with all the features my old macbook pro is missing  i was excited about extending the screen to my ipad pro will be able to paint in photoshop  with sidecar   this feature is completely underwhelming and unpractical to use  mostly due to how interface of this feature is set up   the next feature i was excited to try was installing ipad iphone app to macbook pro    well  this works here and there  applications are crashing    again very underwhelming  three weeks later my new macbook pro started having issues when plugging into the power source through thunderbolt  after i unplug it from power  the second time when plugin it wouldn t charge  i had to unplug the thunderbolt cable both from the power adapter and from a computer and plug it back to the charger first then to the computer in order for mac to charge again  i ran self diagnostic on startup and it would freeze  luckily i was still in the amazon window to return this now broken computer  i don t understand how apple machines became so unreliable  now i m hesitant to order another apple computer as this is the very first new computer i ever purchased turns out to be a lemon ,US,0.9107,positive

2068,i bought this laptop primarily for college  as someone who has dealt with both devils by the name of apple and microsoft  the operating system differences don t bother me  although  one thing i did find is that when i go home and i m not able to do any gaming  it can be a bit of an irritation  but that was never why i bought this laptop to begin with   the screen and battery life on this thing are amazing  my previous laptops had terrible screens and had a max battery life of about two hours  this laptop  between using it for school  doing photo editing  graphic design  coding  and video editing  can easily last me up to two days or even more  the one thing i will say is that frequently in order for me see things most of the time  i need the screen cranked up past     brightness most of the time  i like the touch bar  i barely use function keys in most applications and the apps that do use them have the buttons on the touch bar anyways  i will say though unless you care about the touch bar  a slightly larger battery  and a fan being inside this machine  which for the record  with all of my use of heavy exports and edits  has never once turned on   just buy the macbook air  for school especially  it will get you across fine  the   gb model is also superb in most of the tasks i need to accomplish  i mean  it has similar performance in what i need for compared to my pc with a ryzen     x  and rtx       and   gb of ram  there were a couple of times where webpages tried to use more than  gb of ram and that caused some trouble  but after turning on an ad blocker i never had that issue again  macos has superb memory management  which allows for someone semi professional like me to get by with it just fine ,US,0.9872,positive
2069,i love my macbook pro  i had the    inch macbook air      and i hated that thing  used it for college and i wanted to get rid of it so bad so i gave it away  i always wanted the macbook pro because i thought they were just built better and i the interface of how its designed looked way better  finally was able to buy one and so far so good  i really hope and pray this one doesn t start going slow like how my macbook air did after a year or    bought one for my friend as well and she loves hers  i mainly use it for work  school zoom calls and a little bit of streaming  not a gamer so battery life is something i never have to worry about  battery life was amazing for the first   weeks but  i can tell now the battery has been dying slightly faster but i believe it s from how much i ve been on it lately but if i put it down for a few days  most likely    battery life hangs in there ,US,0.9267,positive

2074,pros  very sleek product  battery life is amazing  fast boot up and general processing speeds cons  hardware soldered to main board preventing or drastically reducing easy hardware upgradesi was stoked to get the laptop at the price point until i discovered what i listed in the con area  now i m stuck with  gb of memory and a    gb ssd    years ago this wouldn t have been a big deal  obviously i could expand storage by using an external source of some sort and tune memory to swap more using virtual disk  but who wants to do that when the original intent was to upgrade the memory and drive after brief use  for lite and everyday computing  this will be more than adequate  for gaming  development  or running virtual platforms do not buy due to the ridiculous effort it will take to upgrade  i m thinking of giving this to my wife in exchange for her      macbook pro that i ve already doubled the memory and drive capacity on with great ease  apple needs to rethink this garbage new era engineering  yes  direct solder makes things run faster to a point  but the trade of losing upgrade capability is not worth it  buyer beware ,US,0.94,positive

2098,the apple macbook pro looks great and  based on all the reviews  it probably is   however  as a    year old man  accustomed to using windows for the past    years  this new macbook pro was very different   the part of it that really makes me angry is the fact that it came with no instructions   i need something to look at and do things  step by step   it started off with a voice tutorial thing that was as confusing and ridiculous as anything i ve ever seen   trying to access the  guide  on my cell phone while trying to set up this macbook was as frustrating as anything i ve ever attempted   for a big company  like apple  to fail so miserably at keeping it simple  is a horrible error   i will struggle through this but i m not happy about how difficult this is for me   some clearly written instructions  included with the machine  would have been nice ,US,-0.8813,negative

2117,i love apple when it comes to computing  their software is efficient  error free and easy to use  their computers perform efficiently and they virtually never freeze up  the only issue with my last mac was that the mag safe power cord would consistently fray and the hard drive cable had to be replaced  x over   years  should change every     yrs   this mac hasnt given me any problems in the first couple days  i did notice a lot of software and drivers dont seem to support the new apple chips yet  but i have no doubt it will eventually happen ,US,-0.0652,negative

2468,macs use to be quite a great computer  however  this computer tends to crash with certain programs  adobe and blender   no ports for sd cards  or usb   i bought numerous external ports  spent at least     on numerous devices  and still i am always forgetting them  i would at least love this feature to come back and or will to pay extra for this feature   this is probably fine for most users but for anyone working with arts  graphics and using different programs etc  this is a real inconvenience  mac has continued to make its products less compatible with other computer brands   overall this will be my last macbook  the drop and drag  and numerous features that made this a great computer and easy to use  were awesome but are no longer worth it  oh yeah  also i lost numerous movies that i had purchased off of my itunes  i contacted the itunes customer service and no help   pretty much i am sad  and frustrated and constantly trying to bend around apples new rules  like not only needing memory space on the computer  which mine is not full  but my icloud is full  after only   or   months of use and they want me to pay a monthly fee to save projects even on my desktop   so i watched a youtube video to remove icloud saving features because its pointless  and took numerous of my projects in progress and changed them  so now i changed it back and it rearranged my whole desktop order and i can not save any video files on this computer or any other project on my desktop  apple has been a throne inside and i caution those who are working on arts  coding etc  to save the stress and frustration and stray away  this computer is pretty much an ipad for people that don t want ipads   ,US,0.9803,positive
2469,let me start off the apple ecosystem is great but what really disappointed me after   months of use the screen starting getting bright spots along the bottom and left side and eventually turned into a mess of different colors rendering that part useless  i got a quote from apple for     dollars to fix the screen including parts and labor and a   month wait time  i also had major connectivity issues with usb products using apples adapter too  it seems as if apples quality has gone down hill lately and this has pushed me away from apple  this will be my last apple product i purchase sadly,US,-0.8702,negative
2470,first off  let me say  i m speaking as a tech enthusiast with a decent understanding of gizmos and gadgets  i ve owned windows pcs  a macbook pro       and a few chromebooks  this is  by far  my favorite computer that i ve ever used  period  let me start with my favorite aspects features  in lovely bullet points for your viewing pleasure  battery life  oh my god  i have to try to kill this thing in one day  full brightness  playing the sims   or world of warcraft  spotify playing  safari and chrome open in the background    i went from about      to     in an hour  and that s the most i could do  usually  i start the day at full battery  then use it on and off all day  and the lowest i ve gotten so far is      by bedtime  it  is  insane  not to mention the standby  which is basically      drop in a day  i cannot stress how amazed i am by the efficiency of this machine  speakers  okay  i know some people don t mind a tinny little laptop speaker because they use headphones  but i am not that person  i like to be able to just play music or videos out loud and enjoy them  well  these speakers are also the best i ve ever heard on a laptop  it s got such a full  defined  crisp sound  i can hear a lot more of the dynamic range and background effects than any other laptop i ve used  it also gets loud  i can use it to fill my room with sound  and in fact i ve had to turn it down a bit at night because my roomies down the hall can hear it  the bass is the only point that isn t a home run  but for what it s worth  i can definitely hear the bass  it just doesn t boom  overall  amaaaazing  keyboard  short and sweet  this is my favorite keyboard  the previous spot was my      macbook pro  but this surpasses that  the keys travel well  i make less mistakes  and it s quiet and comfortable  not much else to say  it s just really good  screen  still a gorgeous retina display  crisp  bright af  colorful  and easy on the eyes thanks to true tone  i m not an artist or video editor  so this is just coming from an average consumer  touch bar  i know this is a divisive opinion  but i personally really like the touch bar  some apps take advantage of it  and it really helps  spotify keeps the controls on the bar  so i can switch and adjust music without having to switch back to the app  the sliders for brightness and volume are easy to press and slide  and frankly i just enjoy it  touch id on the corner is also lovely for logging in  making purchases  or filling forms out on webpages  one touch and you re good  brilliant  form factor  i love this skinny slab of aluminum  i m a minimalist  and it just pleases me to hold and look at  this is completely subjective  but i m a fan  speed  oh my god  this thing is legitimately the fastest computer that i ve ever used  i m honestly shook at how easily it handles anything i throw at it  it runs world of warcraft on high settings at   fps  no other macbook could do that  the   core graphics chip really lives up to its specs  i can have tons of tabs open  a game  things updating in the background  and this guy doesn t break a sweat  all while absolutely sipping battery  fans  yes  the main difference between this and the m  air is that the pro has an active cooling system  that being said  i ve heard the fan come on about   times in   weeks  even when running all that stuff i said before  i m befuddled by how great the thermal dissipation works in this thing  it s good that it has fans  even if it barely uses them less good but still aight  usb c ports  yes  there s only   on the left side  yes  i had to buy an adapter for hdmi and usb a  am i mad about it  not really  i only need to use those things when i m docked at a desk anyway  i use a bluetooth mouse or the touchpad  and i have airpods for headphones  so i don t need to plug many things in anyway  but if you do  definitely invest in an adapter  i use one by anker  with   usb a  an hdmi  and an ethernet port  to add to the usb c impressions  i still miss magsafe  so i actually purchased a  magnetic  usb c cable  which you put the receiver in the macbook usb port  and the cable magnetically attaches to it  just like the old magsafe  this makes me feel safer  because a firm usb c cable sticking out the side makes me nervous  if i were to drop it or hit it on something and mess up the port  highly recommend a cable like this  price  it s expensive  there s no way around that  but i d consider it an investment  because generally speaking  macs last many many years over their windows counterparts  and since this is the first to use apple silicon  i m sure it will be supported for a long while  webcam  it s just not great  the ai enhancements are definitely noticeable and make you look better  but at the end of the day  its a    p webcam in a        computer  come on apple  is     p that hard to add  app compatibility  while i have had almost no issues  some apps may not play nice with the m  right now  the only real issues i had were that the sims   deluxe collection does not work  which i discovered is an issue for everyone with the m  macs  but luckily the devs say theyre working on a fix  so hopefully it s just a small number of apps with issues  other than that  every other app has worked great verdict  i love this computer  sometimes i just sit and marvel at it  sometimes i pick it up just to feel how nice it fits in my hands  it is legitimately my favorite computer  and if you re willing to make the investment  i think it s a fantastic computer for most people  if you don t need the touch bar or extra oomph from the fans  the m  air might be for you  but for me  man  the m  macbook pro is the laptop king  or queen    stars from me update  i ve had the mbp for about   months now  and i m still completely in love with it  i stream on twitch  and i can run obs  a game like world of warcraft  spotify  discord  safari    all without a hiccup  the only real time i get the fans running is when i do this  i have seen the temperature of the cores spike to about     degrees fahrenheit under load  but it s never shut down  it throttled once  as i noticed a slowdown  but i was running literally all those apps plus a discord video call  so i assume either the  gb of ram couldn t handle it  or the cores got too hot  i was really pushing it though  battery is still amazing  and i can run wow classic on max settings easily  overall  still impressed  and still my favorite machine ever ,US,0.9997,positive
2471,on a positive note  keyboard problem has been solved  but new annoyances have been introduced  i m back to transferring pictures by wire  airdrop is too hit and miss  works  but barely  internet search for solutions shows me i am not alone  i ve been on for three hours now  charging  and i ve gone from     to     sluggish connectivity with bluetooth and internet compared to my macbook air of       sitting next to one another on the same wifi network  all kinds of little annoyances also with that bar on top  it is useless  but for sound you have to use it and it is more cumbersome than the simple old way  overheats once a day  i wish i had not bought it  the screen quality is great and i have a tb of memory  but as far as speed and ease is concerned  this thing is a trip back in time  back to steve balmer s microsoft and its contempt for consumers ,US,-0.4479,negative
2472,i was intending to upgrade from my      macbook pro  this new m  silicone computer sucks it s not compatible with lots of programs  and keeps on giving me blue screen and restarts from time to time  not to mention it s always freezing up on just web browsers waste of purchase ,US,-0.5106,negative
2473,   connecting an iphone ipad will brick all apps that didn t come preinstalled  i can no longer add music or audio books to my mobile device  no big deal  just cause i travel a lot why would that be an inconvenience    safari is hit and miss on playing videos  had to install chrome to play online videos    so much for not using google    external monitor does not wake from sleep  requires a restart  if i had known i was going to have to restart my computer every time it goes to sleep i would have bought a windows computer    most of my  rd party apps are buggy  i expected that would be the case for a while    bluetooth is buggy  generally takes several attempts to get something paired    no card reader  really    easy enough to add  but still i ve always known that macos doesn t play well with non apple products  now it doesn t even play well with their own products i am totally disappointed in apple s quality control i didn t expect to spend       on a computer and have to restart and trouble shoot just about every time i use it  if i could do it all over i would stick with the intel processor ,US,-0.1388,negative
2474,i am still waiting on delivery of my     macbook pro but have been running with an m  mac mini  same processor   so far i am blown away  but not surprised  by the performance  for software development workloads the m  is    x faster than my      core i      macbook pro  a compile that takes   m on the mbp takes    on the m  mac  performance benchmarks with open mpi are roughly    x better for both latency and bandwidth  and this is before any additional optimization work for gaming i tested the m  with a native build of world of warcraft  the game was playable      fps  at ultra  level     outputting     p on a     display  the fans do spin up but you never hear them  the     macbook pro has a amd radeon     and struggles to be playable at level   on the internal display  the macbook pro also gets incredibly hot tried a couple of older x   windows games  portal   and   from steam  with crossover    and they were playable at high graphics  very impressive given these are running under rosetta   ,US,0.8356,positive
2475,i bought this laptop in late january  by may  the display was suddenly filled with random lines and blocks  the genius bar assistant ran a test  found the laptop had no scratches  and promised that only the top case and display would be changed  despite my skepticism about the quality behind the macbook pro m  that only lasted   months of usage  i accepted the repair  one week later  i went back to the apple store and casually checked the repaired laptop s case  there were scratches around the top case logo  there was a dent on the bottom case edge  after i brought up these issue  the genius bar assistant became nervous and tried to run a diagnosis test  he couldn t because one of the usb c port was broken  after checking the only other usb c port  the battery was entirely drained and failed the diagnosis test  the cost of the applecare repair was quoted       but the damages it caused was probably close to       if not more  i bought a brand new       macbook pro that in a few months  had turned into a beaten  refurbished product through applecare ,US,-0.89,negative
2476,as a reference  i ve used pc s since the    s  northstar   ibm pc products since the early    s  and mac products since the early    s   i have used the computer as a consumer  a software developer  and an electrical engineer reviewed product      mpb m  chip  mb ram i ve had four mbps since      between home and work apple mac started as a great computing platform  but it has become progressively worse apple is losing their grip problems with this pc     fewer ports   this one has only two  which considering one is for charging  this actually has only one usable port   there is no port on the right side of the computer  save an obsolute analog audio port that nearly nobody uses any more    reliability   this mac continuously locks up and requires reboots the only good feature of this mac is that the keyboard works  which was not a usable feature in the prior mac generation   funny how fixing something that was clearly wrong in a prior generation is seen as an improvement i have not run any different software on this than any of the others  so it is frustrating to see apple move in the wrong direction i m quickly losing faith in the mac platform on the positive side  battery life is awesome   i would trade that for the other features that apple lost the recipe for  like reliability and a usable set of ports ,US,0.8318,positive
2477,apple reached its peak in laptop design in      with the     macbook pro with function keys   it was sleek  slim and powerful   it was beautifully designed inside and out   and with its intel processor  it could also run windows the next version introduced the ugly  tacky  useless touch bar   this turned the beautifully designed      macbook pro into something that looked like one of dell s best effort   it was definitely a step backwards and very un apple like things got interesting when apple threw in the m  chip   though it lost the ability to run windows  its vast performance increase made up for that   unfortunately  the touch bar remained so i held off on upgrading until the     came out and when the     model appeared  it was a disappointment   though with great pleasure the touch bar was ditched  in its place was an ugly notch we see in the current iphones   moreover  the case was slightly thicker and more reminiscent of the aluminum powerbooks of the late     s   this was another step backwards   plus its starting price was a whopping       so i decided i on this model  the          macbook pro  and felt i could live with the touch bar more than the notch   and after   months of use  everything i thought about the touch bar still holds true   it s ugly and useless   i found its constantly blinking display distracting so i made it static  basically turning it into virtual function keys but the main reason for the upgrade was for the m  chip   and this didn t disappoint   the new chip is very speedy  particularly when editing in final cut pro   it handles multi camera hd projects with ease  where my      machine struggled at times   and battery life is longer and the machine in general runs cooler a drawback to the m  chip is many old school apps will not work anymore   so you ll have to spend some time and money looking for equivalent apps despite the ugly touch bar  i recommend this machine over the new     model   it has the m  chip  a display without an ugly notch  and a slimmer body   it s fast enough for most users and it s hundreds of dollars less ,US,-0.6542,negative
2478,owned a      macbook air that had display issues from the get go  but apple said it might be okay if i was super careful handling it   i couldn t go without a laptop for   weeks so decided to risk it   after a couple yrs of being super careful the display became distorted after just a slight bump  and after the warranty period of course   used it hooked up to the tv only for about a year  but as that was difficult in itself  overheating  prevented sleep function  etc   had to change course   didn t wanna pay      for a new display  so   bought the m       macbook air instead  seemed to be operating well until   months in  when i wasn t even anywhere near it and the display went totally out   wouldn t turn on after repeated powering down so called apple   they had me power on with that shift control for    secs and it went on again  however  considering my experience with my last laptop took no chances and brought it in to apple they ran diagnostics and found that the ambient light sensor wasn t working   that s what automatically dims and brightens the screen when going into dark or bright places  in case you  like i  didn t really know what it did   had never dropped this or mishandled it in any way sent in my laptop for repair and it s now been more than a week without and they re still  diagnosing  it   luckily my old laptop is still semi functional if i hook it up to my tv   and i still had a few months left in the warranty   but what if it didn t and i didn t have the old one still functional two times in a row macbook air with serious display issues in the last   yrs  with no accidental damage from me  aside from this  has superior speed and processing power  doesn t overheat  but still takes       sec to power up and the touchpad functionality and the feel of both it and the keyboard are terrible when compared to the      i used to have if you buy an apple laptop now apple care plus is almost mandatory   will have to seriously consider going back to windows for my next laptop update              it s not only the hardware that has gone downhill  but their customer service as well   apparently  when i brought it in to the apple store to be sent for repair  the serial numbers were mismatched somehow that resulted not only in at least a week and half delay  will be receiving my laptop    days after i dropped it off  but i had to spend   hours with customer service  including a two hour phone call  yes  you read that right  where i talked to a tech manager who said the mismatch in store was the  st time he s ever seen that in    yrs   and the ambient light sensor failing in a macbook  usually happens in phone  is something he almost never sees  too   so either i was extremely unlucky or  more likely  the quality of both their hardware design q a and their customer service has gone precipitously downhill and to top it off  was chatting online with one of their customer support reps  who first informed me of the mismatched serial numbers   i then briefly voiced a couple of reasonable questions on how this could have happened  without being rude  and then this rep then completely ghosted the next    comments i wrote over    min   think that s the first time i ve ever been ghosted in a customer service chat the one thing i never really had questions or concerns about apple in the past was its competency   that s obviously not the case now and i m most likely going back to android for my next phones and tablets  as well ,US,0.9812,positive
2479,i needed a laptop for school and chose a macbook since it has a handoff feature and the icloud stuff gets synced which helps a lot  you can copy a text on your ipad and it can be pasted right away to your macbook which is amazing  i got mine with   gb ram and it works great  it never lags and i play sims   on it to with over   gb of custom content  cc  and mods  my game will never lag it loads super fast and works seamlessly  the fans rarely come on whenever i m doing schoolwork  they do however come in during sims gameplay but that s normal since it s a heavy game  it doesn t get hot either  the battery life is great  i ll use it     hrs day and the battery can last most of the week  the touch bar is amazing  i don t know why people hate it  i use it a lot of the times and find it very useful  you can unlock your macbook with your watch as well  this laptop is perfect  it does take some getting used to if you ve never been on mac and only windows  but it is definitely very similar to my gaming pc  the m  chip is insane  i definitely recommend and it is worth the money ,US,0.9888,positive

2483,i love the seamless integration and interactions it has with my apple watch  airpods  and iphone  i know people who don t have more than one apple device hear all the time that having more than one always works great because of the ecosystem but usually only take it at face value  i was one of those people even up until i had my apple watch for a while but the macbook really hooked me in  once you realize how everything just works you don t know how you were able to do it before  of course there is the whole walled garden argument everyone that dislikes apple love to talk about but in reality i don t care if this walled garden is at war the rest of the world it s the best  most simple  and seamless ecosystem for the average consumer  there is a learning curve for those that come from other operating systems like the different feel of the keyboard  shortcuts  trackpad  and overall os  but i ve only been using this device for short while and already caught on super quick  i feel like despite all these positives there is still the high price  i purchased the     gb model and it came to around       with a sale so it might take a while for the slight buyer s remorse to go away but i feel like the more i use it the quicker i become satisfied with my purchase  my final thoughts would have to be  if you have the money to purchase this at any configuration then go for it  simply keep in mind there is a lot that goes into the satisfaction for this product  the ecosystem which would require more apple devices  the willingness to learn a new os  understanding the added level of security and privacy that comes with apple devices and the use case for each individual ,US,0.9883,positive

2487,i already had an hp laptop that had no problems other than the battery life was lacking  so  why did i get another one  i m about to start nursing school at the end of august which requires you to have a laptop all day  about   hours   my dad surprised me this macbook  i am an apple girl through and through  watch  phone  airpods   to say that i was over the moon receiving my first macbook was an understatement  i ve been testing it out for about a week now  it came in perfect condition  no scratches or problems with the screen  this computer is fast when it comes to everything  as soon as you open it  it is on  i seriously can t catch it off no matter how little i open it  every web page pops up quick and loads quicker  i m amazed that i can text through this macbook and it synced all of my stuff from the cloud effortlessly  it has a touch bar that is insanely cool and in my opinion  useful  the battery life  omg the battery life  i purposely did everything in my power to drain it  i am on day   of using it without charging it and it is at      now  i haven t been on it all day everyday  i have mainly used it to write  read  and text  however  i ve used for a good   hours each day  if you re a college student who needs a reliable computer this one is for you     it is      worth every penny  if you want coverage for the macbook always go through apple  they will give you the best bang for your buck ,US,0.8934,positive
2488,apple makes absolute trash laptops and offers no support whatsoever  i bought one in      and it s already broken twice and the cost of a repair is as much as a new computer  i will never buy another apple laptop as they only put out trash  my previous macbook pro was from       that s how much the quality of these paper weights has gone down  stay away  if i can prevent   person from spending this much money on literally anything else  i will be happy ,US,0.296,positive
2489,i have a      macbook pro  i use it for everything from adobe software to office   i bought the m  as it is supposed to be the fastest  and perhaps it is  but if i am just on the internet or using microsoft word to write a paper for school  it does not outdo the intel in my previous laptop   i put them next to one another to test the speed on chrome   my entire life is on chrome  so switching to safari would be a pain   i use it at work and personal   it is ridiculously slow compared to my old macbook   i took it back to the store and showed them  and they replaced my laptop thinking it was a hardware issue   no  it is still the same   after researching  apparently this is the case with the new m    it does not run chrome or microsoft office efficiently   if you don t need these apps  then go for it  but if you do  you will find yourself frustrated that it takes so long to load a page just going through the internet ,US,-0.9081,negative

2494,i bought a     macbook pro   gb   tb directly from apple but i wanted to leave my thoughts here in case anyone is on the fence  it is worth it  the new m  chip is able to keep up with my workflow without breaking a sweat when all the other pcs and macs in my office have to ramp up their fans to try to keep up  battery life for me lasts around    hours of hard work when my previous mac would have died within   hours  this is truly a next generation product ,US,-0.1531,negative

2536,i primarily use my macbook pro for music production and performance  as such  logic pro and myriad amp models plugins are constantly in use on my machine  the m  chip blows the intel chips out of the water in terms of loading speed  battery life  and ability to handle large logic projects with dozens of tracks  plugins  software instruments  and live recordings battery life has also seen a significant improvement over my      intel machine  i am not quite getting double the battery life  but it s not far off  this isn t a huge deal for me  as my machine is typically stationary and a charging cable is readily available  but for someone who needs the portability  the difference is substantial update          i have been using this laptop for over   months now on a daily basis  i have done everything from word documents  email  web surfing  logic pro  neural dsp guitar plugins  adobe lightroom  adobe illustrator  and many other tasks and i do not think that i have even heard the fan come on   time  it s pretty astounding  the m  is still exceedingly snappy and the battery life blows me away  and while more and more apps become native to m   i d expect performance to do nothing but improve ,US,0.9436,positive

2541,apple hit it out of the park with the new m  chip  it outperforms i  laptop from a year ago by a long shot  plus outperforms most while having a over    hour battery life  i not no apple fan  but this laptop is great  plus they finally got rid of the dreaded butterfly keyboard that would fail even when we ll taken care of and when back to the older but mature scissor keyboard design  the screen is accurate  if your looking to upgrade  this is the one to get  or even go with the base model with out touch bar and still will outperform the intel macs and other laptops  while having the best power management on any laptop seen to date  while at a finally reasonable price ,US,0.8913,positive
2542,starting in the early      s i became a strictly apple girl for all electronic devices  i love the easy integration between devices and as a person with a disability it means a lot to have that interconnect ability  i previously had a macbook pro from      and it was malfunctioning badly  the replacement cost exceeded its value so invested that repair cost into this macbook pro  it s come a long way since       i love how light weight it is  i swear it s lighter than my macbook air from      was  i like the touch display but i mainly only use it for emojis    i had big sur on my previous mac but it ran slow  this macbook works so much faster than what i had before  the screen is brilliant and gorgeous  i had read this macbook could run any app on my phone  the reality is it s only a few apps  what i wanted to work the most was instagram  and that does not work on this  there are several apps though and that s a nice feature i m not techie from a hardware position but i am an advanced user from a software perspective and i am really happy with this this ,US,0.9855,positive
2543,it s a solid apple product  and i was way overdue to get a laptop  i researched and considered several pre owned models  but the cost on this macbook pro and the m  chip made it a clear choice  with used refurbished computers  there are still risks  not to mention lower battery life and physical damage  with a brand new machine  those chances are almost completely gone i m so glad i went with the new macbook pro  and if i decide to  upgrade   i know this machine will hold its value in the used market ,US,0.88,positive
2544,i purchased this laptop because my previous laptop  a behemoth of a gaming laptop  broke suddenly broke down  it was great  except for the fact that it felt a little slow  maybe it is because i had downgraded from a    hz screen to a   hz screen  or maybe because my previous laptop was a performance monster  it just didn t feel that good  however  other than that  it is an amazing laptop  very portable  and doesn t really heat up that much  also  it charges super fast  therefore i could charge it for    min to   hour in the morning and go the the whole day without having to worry about charging it  overall  it is an amazing product  however  it wasn t the one for me ,US,0.9349,positive

2591,update              after three weeks  i m still really impressed with the m  macbook air   core cpu   core gpu     ssd  gb ram      my updated plea  make sure you get as much memory   storage as you can afford  special order one to your projected future need remember  macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in   or even    years  not that long ago     gb hard drives were huge    and upgradable  ram was upgradable  the ssd and the ram in these machines is not upgradable the one issue for me has been that i am a memory hog  i tend to have lots of tabs open at once  i ve caught myself with     safari  open in one browser and     chrome  in another    while running affinity final cut pro   and yes  the dreaded beach ball has reared it s ugly head  well  this got me to assess what i will be using the machine for and for how long storage can be added with external drives  slower  but it will let you scrape by  ram is another story  when you constantly use up ram  the system starts using  swap memory  where it uses the ssd to store temporary files  one of the youtube reviewers  created labs  explains it like this  ram memory is like writing on a white board  it s made to be temporary  writing to the ssd is like writing on paper with a pencil  it can be erased  but if it s written on and erased for too long  it s going to degrade the medium  it will take years for this to cause problems  but keep in mind that in these m  macbooks  none of the parts are replaceable  the ssd and the ram are soldered onto the board    as ridiculously expensive as apple ram is  when it s not upgradable  get the maximum  in this case     gb i really doubt that apple will be making machines with user upgradable ram after the switch from intel is complete  except for possibly the very high end pro models there is also the fact that if i am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing  a m  with a fan will be helpful  upgrading to the cheaper       upgrades  m  mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the pro apps  but i need a laptop  so    so  that is why i m planning to return this machine and get one  likely the macbook pro m    with    gb ram     tb ssd    a note on browsers  safari is by far the best browser to run on the m   at least for now  i always had issues with saving web pages as pdf files in chrome  where it did not save most of the images text on the page  in safari  it s worked perfectly       i purchased the macbook air m     core gpu  and   core cpu model  with     gb ssd and   gb ram in person at the apple store               with education pricing  i traded in my  mnyh ll a             macbook with the intel m  processor      gb ssd    gb ram  i kept my charging adapter   c cable  which are both compatible with the m  late      macbook air   so ended up with a      apple store instant credit towards the m  the m  model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open  including final cut   logic pro  admittedly the      mb was the bottom of the line and i suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single c port fiasco i likely would have gone with the   core gpu model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase  but i wanted     gb of ssd space  so i paid more by going with eh   core  from everything that i ve seen  the lack of more ram upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the intel x   processors and is really only useful when you have many gpu intensive  pro apps  running at the same time i would never have dreamed of running final cut or logic pro on the      macbook  so this has been an amazing upgrade for me i would say that the bottom line is that if you re someone who only uses a laptop for office   basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once  and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball  not responding  issues  or if you have non apple programs that have not been compiled for the m  chip  hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the m   if however  you really need a machine that is much more capable  faster and cooler running than the intel models  it s a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non upgradable mac ,US,0.9727,positive
2592,the m  chip really is amazing  but it only lasted five days for me  somehow mine managed to break after using a third party usb c hub  the screen wouldn t turn on at all  and an apple repair tech couldn t figure it out after doing a few quick tests  oh and then apple said it would take a month to replace it with a new one ,US,0.726,positive

2594,i have two macbook airs  mba   a     and a     both with the previous form factor  the wide  body colored bezel around the screen      x    resolution  and this new     mba improves upon it in every way  almost  and makes it nearly perfect good   screen looks great       x     resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel   i usually don t go above     brightness   keyboard is good   some have mentioned that it still sucks  but i find it much better than the older mbas that i own and better than say  the magic keyboard   even with a thin silicone keyboard cover i find the typing experience to be much better and i can type faster and with fewer mistakes   battery life is fantastic   haven t done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors  wifi usage  video streaming  hd vs  k video viewing processing etc   screen brightness  type of app being used  etc   but for my usage  mostly web browsing  video viewing on youtube  accessing vpn for work  citrix  epic   etc   it has been great   easily tops    hours and super impressed so far   looks great   love the newer  i know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now  design  looks and feels great   form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight   no fan   that s awesome  as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap   pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans   performance   it works great so far on what i have used it for  which is not terribly a lot  but it is what it is for a laptop using apple silicon for the first time   for just day to day use and things like chrome  office  word  excel   citirx  epic  etc   it has been super smooth and fast   have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with   core gpu   also  things like start up are noticeably faster with the m  versus my      imac      top end  with intel chips   touch id is great still   works very fast and the button does not get greasy  which makes it not work well  like the old iphone home buttons   on the other hand  it should really have face id at this point   apple ecosystem is great as usual and a real reason to get this mba   apple watch easily unlocks it  so you do not really need face id if you have the watch    you can easily send receive files using airdrop or cast using airplay   and so on and so forth   big sur comes preinstalled but you need to update to get        not good   webcam still sucks   still low resolution and just does not look good in facetime  teams  etc   shame that apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the macs  the     imac finally upgraded to     p front cams only a couple months ago    i got one and it looks so much better than this mba s camera    only   ports   sad that this thing has only   usb c ports  that cover thunderbolt    usb      charging  displayport    given that it is used to charge  it leaves only one usb c port for other use  pretty lame   i wish they had squeezed  i think it would fit  a usb a port so that i could plug in my wireless mouse usb a dongle as i have never liked any bluetooth mouse  or at least one more usb c port   new tech  apple silicon  means the m  optimized apps are still being rolled out  e g  photoshop still not available at release   battery still cannot be removed  no surprise here  but means that like all apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non removable battery   easier to have an iphone s battery replaced than a mba i would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for   years at the minimum overall a few negatives  mostly the webcam  but enough significant improvements that this mba is really a no brainer for anyone needing a non power notebook compute  especially if s he is already in the apple ecosystem   love it so far ,US,0.9995,positive

2596,lightweight  blazing fast  easy to use  battery life is incredible with the new apple m  chip   a typical great apple product however  there is only a thunderbolt port  so you now have to go out and buy a cable to convert usb to thunderbolt  if you want to use a backup hard drive  or other usb items  and  i had to buy yet another cable to sync my phone s lightning port to the thunderbolt port on the computer  total     i love apple product  and worked for them in my caerer  but i would wait on buying this version until the software for it has been developed update  after several months of using this computer  i have have found several things of concern     my notification center keeps disappearing  despite my constant reinstalling the widgets     my computer s calendar  reminders  and photo stream do not sync with my ios devices  iphone   ipad    if i add an item to calendar on my phone  it will appear on my mac but not vice versa   reminders will not sync regardless of which device i originate the item on i have contacted apple support on all these issues and they cannot solve the problem it appears that the bugs have not been worked out  yet   things are maddeningly clunky ,US,0.891,positive

2601,i wanted a new macbook since it s been several years since i got my last mac and the battery was going bad with a delicious gold color and an overall thin  sleek design  this computer is for those who want their computer to look a bit more  fancy  than other options on the market with the m  chip  everything is extremely fast  i was able to set up this new machine with    minutes i am not sure if i would recommend this machine to those who have recently upgraded to a mac       to now  but if it s been several years and you want to splurge  go for this as a writer  the keyboard is so smooth and i feel like i can type more words per minute on this machine my only complaint is the webcam  while better  is still not up to par to other computer cameras on the market  facetime looks a bit grainy still and photo booth is just a joke  the quality barely looks different than recent models overall  this is a great addition to the mac family  i look forward to see how apple utilizes the m  chip in the future       ,US,0.9405,positive

2604,i m a software developer and i ve only used pc for my entire career  i ve been using the windows subsystem for linux and other unix based shells for work for a long time and i ve always had the desire to try development on a mac i assumed that it would be like any other windows machine that s had the os replaced with linux  one of my favorite computers was a lenovo with ubuntu on it so that s what i expected i bought a surface pro x which has an arm based processor  ms sq  chip  so i thought that i knew what to expect  i assumed that it would be frustrating that the majority of the software i used probably wouldn t work correctly but i have to say that apple did so much better than microsoft on this one  the m  chip makes this        laptop feel like a       laptop  i ve only run into one application that couldn t run and the general online community recommended an alternative for me the most difficult thing for me was getting used to the different keyboard layout but once i did  this laptop has been nothing short of a pleasure to work with and has replaced my surface laptop   as my daily driver and primary software development machine i might revert to my surface laptop three if i go back to  net development in the future but for the general web stuff i typically do  i couldn t ask for a better machine the battery life is excellent  this laptop feels premium  i have no doubt that this will last me well into the future and it has completely changed my mind about apple the biggest downside in my opinion is that i spent a fortune on accessories and peripherals because apple products tends to exist in their own separate ecosystem which can be a bit frustrating one thing that everyone should be aware of is that you can t connect this laptop to two separate external displays  i had to get used to one external display and then using a virtual desktop  that is unfortunate because i really liked having three monitors at all times but i haven t found a way to make it work with this machine generally speaking  i would recommend this to anybody who s considering it  unless you are a pc gamer  there s very little that this computer won t excel at  i d argue that it might be the best quality laptop in this price range by a factor of two  and i have historically been very critical of apple ,US,0.9584,positive

2606,if i could go back i probably would though past the time now i d say i m computer savvy  spent years of time on windows programs  photoshop etc  now that my current dell inspiron is reaching the end of its life  i followed all the great reviews and purchased this macbook air m  everything is hard  i actually loved my dell in many ways  though hopefully its life  around     years  is about half what this mac will be things i m missing the most so far  a touch screen  the ability to fully open ie fold back and flatten the rotation the screen  even the fact of needing to use   fingers to take screen shots instead of an allocated button  the delete button is actually a back space not delete button  notifications keep coming in upper right corner  blocking what i might want to access there  one needs to go through each app to change the setting btw  there s no default to say do not show notifications  it would at least be good to have the option to change the location of where they show up  i much prefer chrome to safari  though found on reading that chrome eats up a lot more power  i downloaded flotata this morning which is supposed to help though i haven t tried yet  incredibly frustrating especially when time is very limited  trying to figure things out   have spent hours on calls with apple support which thankfully is very accessible  but my computer seems glitchy  sometimes the screen sharing doesn t work  i haven t purchased a mouse as yet for it and also finding  right clicking  with   finger tapping to be frustrating and not working as i d expect it to overall unfortunately not a happy camper  maybe for mac users it may be a good machine for whatever reason i was also very torn whether to get the   or   gb  i went with the    i don t think that would make a difference at this early stage of being new i also tried to have my teen daughter  who s used to macs  give me tips though she was t terribly helpful so i watched a couple of youtube vids which gave some guidance  things are not intuitive i don t like posting negative reviews  though sharing this in case others in similar situations ie needing to carry on with trying to get things done  while their windows laptop is reaching the end of its life and needing to choose a new machine  may find this helpful also as an fyi  i had to pay an additional nearly      to have my   external hard drives transferred onto a new mac compatible one  so i can access all my previous work wishing everyone better luck ,US,0.8367,positive

2619,buying into the apple ecosystem should only be done to make products for the ecosystem which will make the user money  but  do not make them a critical part of your workflow   they are too expensive for that   apple just does not make good computers   yes  they make a ok operating system  but they make computers that cannot be repaired by taking out the ssd or ram sticks and putting new ones in you can t just go and buy the parts to fix your mac computers when they break   the macbook air is no exception to this   the ssd is solider to the motherboard   likewise the ram   now  if that were the only problem  well    one would be able to get someone skilled to replace these broken pieces after apple stop warranty coverage    maybe   but  they don t even allow the suppliers of these chips to supply them to the public   so  once the warranty is  up    you will not be able to get spare parts for the computer   needless to say  this is a major flaw in apple products    of which it is no exception for this macbook air    oh  and if they start allowing suppliers to supply  but  lock down with crypto keys to a particular machine we just have even more e waste  also  this computer flickers with a  k output   the macbook air has screen flicker with an external monitor using the hootoo dock that i ve used with an intel macbook pro which is a few years old   this is unacceptable   apple s response to the sometimes frying the computer for using usb c docks that work with other computers is an example of the poorly built computer they are pushing though poorly engineered in terms of video  ssd  and ram   it is a wonderful typing experience when using the laptop keyboard   if you are willing to let that guide you  then  the computer may be worth it if you are willing to set aside another grand when ssd fails or you plug in the wrong dock to drive an external monitor even though someone else just had their intel mac plugged in and worked just fine    supposedly apple fix this with an os update    good for them  even though i dislike the mac  it is better than most laptops    because it is quiet since it has no fan   would i buy one again  perhaps    it is a question of whether i think the market exists for me to make money off of it the good things keyboard  touchpad  built in screen  build in speakers  drives external audio better than microsoft windows  and the operating system is less cluttered than is windows   also  comes with a spreadsheet  word processor  presentation program    now  it is better just to use something really libre    like libreoffice   but  it is kind of nice the table steaks are included    unlike for microsoft windows ,US,0.0527,positive
2620,im sure its amazing for die hard mac users  however  the one port is a non starter for me  i opened it started it up and one i realized i had to buy accessories to add anything additional  i cleaned it and packed back up to return  one port is horribly inconvenient for my needs  and having to carry around an accessory to add even one more is a waste of my energy  i can and will purchase something more adaptable and suited to my needs,US,-0.7165,negative
2621,it s not a bad little laptop   i am not a techie person so don t expect fancy tech terms or a deep understanding of all things apple in this review   i m your standard user looking for a dedicated  decent machine for work without breaking the bank the m  chip is supposed to be crazy fast compared to the previous version and yes  so far it is pretty good   i use a graphic webpage called canva and i am constantly getting a message telling me that it s using excessive power   slowing my macs performance down   this even happens with candy crush    i haven t noticed any decrease in performance though i also have the      macbook air and it s facetime video is far superior to this      version which is very low quality and grainy   i think my      hp has a better quality video   so if you re looking for clear  crisp video for zoom meetings you won t find it here   i mean really  i expected a lot more from an apple product the power cord is not magnetic like the       which to me was a much better design    someone  is forever tripping over my cord and yanking it out which was fine with the      version but this one will end up damaged if i can t find a way to get it out of the way   small spaces are challenging   i had to buy a compatible hub so that i could continue using my usb wireless mouse   flash drives since this macbook air only has    thunderbolt usb  ports   one of them is for the power cord   it s not backwards compatible with all of my standard usb devices and no place at all for an sd card i do love the convenience fingerprint login keychain feature   i love that it s very quiet  so far  and other than facetime the colors and screen resolution are excellent and vibrant as advertised ,US,0.9845,positive

2625,i have used microsoft windows based computers      since        now for the  st time i decided to try apple out instead to see how windows compares to a macbook   only been a few days and i already see things unfamiliar i am learning  so far   i have to say the speed of the new m  processor compared to any of the windows    computers is very impressive and just the speed and  faster response  the macbook seems to have combined with the programs i have downloaded and a few i purchased i would have to say i prefer the macbook   i added a   port usb hub and a trackball i use instead of the built in pad but other then that i have not changed a thing   it definitely does everything i need it to do both business related an for pleasure   i also enjoy the small portable size and will be taking it on it s first trip in just a few days   if anyone is a current windows user and is considering the switch to try out a macbook i would say go for it and do not look back    if you purchase one and later decide you would prefer not to stick with it a macbook seems to hold their value much better then the majority of windows based computers out there ,US,0.9724,positive

2630,i love this little computer  when i was looking for a laptop to buy  i almost went with a used  older macbook air  i decided to just spend the extra money and get a brand new computer and the newest model and i m so happy i did because apple s m  chip is impressive  after two months of owning this laptop  i think my favorite thing is the battery life  for lighter tasks  web browsing  listening to music  steaming netflix etc   the battery could last the entire day  and i love how i can take this thing anywhere with me without having to lug a charger around as well  for heavier tasks  it of course doesn t last all day but you get a lot of hours out of the battery  it rarely gets hot  and doesn t even have a fan  so you know how efficient that chip is running  i also love the fanless design because i can have it with me in my bed or anywhere and not worry about blocking vents or getting dog hair in those fans  i don t use it for anything crazy  mainly just work and personal stuff  along with frequent streaming and occasionally i ll fire up the sims    and it runs beautifully by the way   but i m never not impressed by how quick it is  opens applications almost instantly and wakes instantly  also  i am new to mac with this purchase but have owned iphones for a decade and i love the seamless integration jumping between applications on your laptop and phone  so far i m loving big sur and basically this is just a laptop that would be great for almost anyone ,US,0.9947,positive

2650,i have had the m  macbook air    inch now since december       it has served me so well and has been one of the most reliable laptops i ve ever owned  i am originally a pc guy and now work back and forth between windows os and mac os when it comes to rendering videos and clips  this does a way better job at  k resolution compared to my former alienware    inch laptop and my workplace s gaming desktop i am pretty happy with the battery life so far  i have been getting     hours of hard real world usage  i bring a nice usb c portable battery with me to charge it when i am doing work on the weekends out of town or while on the plane  this thing has not failed me once  gb of ram is more than enough for the majority of consumers and is enough for me even though i edit photos and videos all the time  i have not seen any  throttling  from the m  macbook air since ownership  i can even open up     tabs on chrome without issue    gb storage is enough as long as you have an external storage  i highly recommend investing in getting an ssd or nvme external storage so transfer speeds are optimal  otherwise  as long as you are keeping the core hard drive tidy  you won t run into any storage issues virtual classes are nice  the webcam quality is crystal clear  and it is noticeably better than most of my peers my only complaint is that the design is a bit  outdated  despite how premium and beautiful it is just fyi  i just bought two of these  one for myself and one for my friend who just had a massive upgrade from her  prehistoric       imac  she was absolutely mindblown by how much faster and better it is compared to the older imac overall  this is a very nice all around computer laptop for any student from k all the way up to the graduate level  go get this beast of a machine now for      ,US,0.9923,positive

2654,this laptop is really fast and the battery lasts really long the battery lasts me about a week with just one charge and i find that crazy there is not fan noise and this doesn t get hot the quality is really good   i mean the way the laptop opens with one hand and the smooth closing of the lid is really smooth the screen isn t the best but its still really good this laptop has the m  chip  fastest chip on the market this laptop s bench marks are off the roof it s great for casual use like  watching movies  using word docs and excel sheet  coding and video editing i wouldn t recommend gaming even though basic games will do just fine ,US,0.9825,positive
2655,so for the most part i use this for when i am traveling or out and about for my business  i find it the right size for the job i am doing and take advantage of apples cloud storage and ways of using other mac s as storage for information so this doesn t use storage much at all  where this is nice is the quick user functionality it has in access these documents or programs needed seamlessly and being able to help keep my business moving on the road  most of the time i am using browser programs to access the business info or using the cloud to access files back at the home base which is the new mac mini with an external hard drive that houses the business information  i find that the size makes a great traveling companion for onsite work  when connecting to a shared internet connection it is nice knowing that the channel is mostly secure and when using my iphone shares cell connection and new chips they can help create a safe network for my means of work  if you are debating getting one for business i recommend using their cloud storage so you eliminate the focus on storage anxiety and makes it more worth it in the long run of having a user interface focused laptop  also the battery for most of the work i am doing lasts me a week with heavy workload   days max  honestly you can t get too much better for a long lasting apple hardware focused product ,US,0.9897,positive
2656,this is a very solid device   wonderful job  apple   the only thing unexpected about it was the weight    the dimensions are smaller than the old macbook air my wife had  but heavier   screen size is the same  thinner bezzle around the edges  i am going to give it   stars because    come on   apple s own m  processor   but i will throw in a provisio   google s chrome  native for the m  processor  seg faults quite a bit on this unit  though it has slowly been getting better as google has updated the application to work better with the m    i do expect google will fix these issues over the next few weeks  it is a very new system after all and a new architecture target for chrome   but beware of that i do wish apple had kept the mag safe power supply  but i m not gonna dock apple any stars for using usb c for charging  matt,US,0.931,positive

2658,this macbook is definitely great for users who want lots of power and versatility  but don t want to break the bank  it is very lightweight and sleek the color  gold  is also very pretty  but keep in mind that it is more of a pinkish gold than a yellow gold  however  the camera quality is not great for such an otherwise powerful laptop  especially in this era of zooming and facetiming  a good camera is essential in a laptop  it s not terrible  but its not great either  another thing   the front lid of the macbook got a couple of scratches very easily  i was able to get them off  but i would suggest getting a good quality case to ensure that this doesn t happen  all in all i would rate this macbook a        definitely lived up to the hype ,US,0.9937,positive
2659,i have always wanted a macbook  ever since i was a little kid  but  there was always something that stopped me from getting one  they always mentioned that the air wasn t very good  from      all the way up to       reviews always mentioned the multiple flaws macbook air had  from the thermal throttling  to the super small ssd      at base price   over        then the butterfly keyboard etc  the list went on and on  and i really thought that it wasn t worth the money  until  wwdc       apple announced they would start making their own chips straight from home  i was so excited for this new generation  it reminded me of the time when they went from powerpc to intel  the excitement was there  and i loved the new unibody that started in       with the removal of unnecessary ports for the average joe  everything was the same  but the new m  chip  that is when i realized that this m  macbook air was the one for me  i didn t hesitate and started saving until i had enough to buy it  and  i absolutely made the best decision in purchasing it  it is amazing  it s super slim  portable  super fast processing speed and power  the screen is beautiful  the bezels are unnoticeable  the keyboard is outstanding  to be completely honest  this laptop makes you want to be more productive  just because of its speed and its ease of use  if you re thinking about purchasing a mac  this by far is one of the better choices  and the cheapest nonetheless  the charger is also outstanding    w is all you need for this little thing ,US,0.9979,positive

2666,first time macbook owner  really happy with the macbook air  don t let the lack of a fan be off putting  the only time it gets even remotely warm is when rendering a video in imovie  even then  it s by no means hot to the touch  this is probably the most fail proof laptop out right now and dare i say  ever  the lack of a fan eliminates the last mechanical part and means this laptop have no moving parts  the soldered in m   storage and committing to your ram choice for the life of the laptop is my only complaint  so far i m not finding  gb of ram to be an issue  most of the programs for mac os are pretty well optimized for the m  chip  so everything feels to work pretty smoothly  the battery life is next level  over all it s more powerful  cooler and the battery lasts longer than ever  if you have been wanting to get your first macbook or have been batting around the idea of an upgrade  this would not be a bad choice ,US,0.9223,positive

2670,we bought the laptop in dec       after a couple of weeks  it had a big os update  big sur to monterey  the problems started happening   i kept getting locked out  passwords not working  account name not working   resulting to my having to run to the mac service center  x the first time they said the update caused some issues  second one said  it was a file vault issue also  noticed how since the update my battery life has decreased  the tech guys said this is normal after an update due to the machine still settling and should stabilize soon  it s been a couple of weeks and still the same  i ve even heeded the advice of not logging out nor shutting down  just folding the laptop  to let the machine keep working on the kinks  also because it s an m  technology so no need to formally shut it down like a pc not sure of what s really going on  tbh perhaps it is due to apples newest os being buggy  or it could be the unit is a lemon  not sure  but giving it one last chance and if it fails me again before the    day warranty is up  i am returning it ,US,-0.775,negative
2671,the device is silent because it has no fans  the screen isn t oled but it looks incredible for watching movies with vibrant colors and is very sharp making it great for text documents with small fonts  the battery life is incredibly good i can constantly get over a day with moderate to high use and yet somehow still manages to be an incredibly light device  it has a good dac and plenty of volume making it a good choice for audio lovers  especially if you use open backs since it makes no noise  and if you don t use headphones the speakers can get very loud and sound really good for a laptop  it runs mac os which can be hard to adapt too but it is alot less power intensive than windows so you rarely have to worry about overheating or battery in daily use  if you are a professional video or photo editor or run intensive task look towards a pro computer and for everyone else this is a great choice ,US,0.9909,positive
2672,i ve worked on and serviced macs for many years  but i ve never considered purchasing one for the price  macs have never been a good value  i wanted a       laptop  and my choices quickly narrowed to this  it has the best laptop processor and the best screen money can buy  especially at this price  the battery life on macbooks is always good  so i knew that wouldn t be an issue after purchase  i ve come to the same conclusions  the screen is wonderful  bright and high res  excellent color accuracy  the m  processor speed has blown me away with its performance  i don t need much ram or storage  so i m still happy with that  i do wish for more ram  but i don t necessarily need it for my work i do  what has blown my mind more than anything else is the battery life  i ve never had a laptop like this  i don t have to carry a charger with me anymore  the macbook easily handles a full day of charge  i also like the fact that it doesn t have a fan  i don t have to worry about thermals when getting comfy in my bed and doing some light work overall  best laptop i ve ever purchased  i ve had no issues over more than a month of ownership  and i m super picky about tech as well as slightly anti apple  so i ve basically converted because of this machine ,US,0.99,positive

2680,not long ago i decided to get far from apple products because some work necessities i couldn t cover with an iphone and a mac  the limitation of the iphone for some advanced features  like dual sim and the possibility to flash os images from a ssd  and the need to use bootcamp in the mac made me jump to an android phone and a windows computer i had a samsung s    and a huawei matebook pro with windows and linux  both devices are impeccable  really made my work easier in so many aspects  but as time passed my life wasn t getting simpler like it was with my iphone and my mac apple products work flawlessly between each other and there are always new implementations that simplifies everyday life  quality of this products and its software is incredible  although other products have better capabilities   for example my matebook outperforms this macbook air m  and has a much better quality screen  they lack the simplicity and stability being all this said  the macbook air m  is a really great laptop  the most basic version which is the one i bought is blazing fast  stable and with a great battery life  much better than the huawei matebook pro   also its absolute silent and fresh  its doesn t get hot at all to make my work easier i had to pay for some software that saddly i was denied to pay on the mac at the beginning   apple products are expensive but i ve learned that in the long run they are worth it  life is about time and how you spend it and apple definitely focus its effort to simplify the time you use to do a task i wanted to share my story in case you are in a situation like i had  if you have an iphone and other apple products don t doubt  buy a macbook air m   i still have a beefy windows machine for gaming  rendering  and other things  but most of the time i rather work in my new macbook ,US,0.9912,positive
2681,can t add much that hasn t already been said  i upgraded from a      macbook air and find this to be superior in just about every way  the battery life is at least twice what the      was  the screen is much better  the keyboard is better  the overall size of the computer is smaller and i love the larger haptic feedback touchpad  i don t use the camera but it isn t the greatest from what i understand and i do kind of miss the magsafe connector ,US,0.9044,positive

2689,what i liked  apple s construction quality is second to none  unboxing this is a delight  it s just a beautiful machine  you can start working with it as soon as the initial setup is done  which might take a few minutes  love the display  bright colors  nice resolution  everything looks crisp  keys are a delight to type with  real smooth  battery life is the best i ve ever witnessed  i just recharge this thing every other day  whereas my previous laptop would use three rounds of charge a day  and i had for just one year  what i disliked  some of my favorite apps are still not ready for apple silicon or m  chip  it s given me two or three random reboots with cryptic error logs already  and coming from over    years using mostly windows  and some     years using linux  i feel like i have to rewire my brain to start using the fn  control  option   command keys properly all in all  it s a really solid laptop although i feel like i still haven t made the most out of it  no heavy usage so far  except for some minor audio production work  guess i ll do it eventually  hope app compatibility gets better with time too  that s the reason for the missing star up there  otherwise  it would ve been   stars all the way ,US,0.9866,positive
2690,likes  happy wifebut seriously  i m not a macos user  personally  but my wife is and she loves it  her old      macbook pro could finally be put to rest these machines last a long time  the battery life easily lasts her two full days of use  probably around    hours  as a nurse  she s constantly looking up new techniques or reviewing current literature  so her next laptop needed to be power efficient  but powerful the m  does just that the screen quality is second to none as you can expect from apple products this particular mac       macbook air m      does not have the touchbar that thepros do   and we re glad  it felt out of place when we were trying out the new lineup of macs this air also has the  new  keyboard  which is just apple going back to their old style of chiclet keyboard a fan favorite also  this air never gets hot  this is something new to me as i m used to devices running too hot after long usage  but the air s m  is so efficient the laptop doesn t need a fan ,US,0.9891,positive
2691,the m  chip is amazing and a miracle  this little chip can play some of the most cpu demand games around cities skylines it played phenomenal without any lag or freezing  this macbook air is very powerful  the downside to it  is that it doesn t have a cooling fan and one cooling fan in it would make a major improvement ,US,0.9608,positive
2692,idk what to say but this crazy macbook is awesome apple makes a sweet ass tv  thanks apple for adding the extra keyboard for tapping on zzzzoooommmm     its a really i am trying to figure the ins and outs of this thing always finding new stuff ,US,0.7118,positive
2693,i bought this      macbook air    gb ram      gb ssd storage  to replace a      macbook air   gb ram      gb ssd storage    i am undeniably a fan of apple products in general  because they work with little fuss and are built to last  note that my old macbook air is more than   years old and still working perfectly    although i ve been underwhelmed by some mac models in recent years  this one is stellar imho   unless you have very heavy system requirements this machine would be an excellent choice the m  processor is very impressive  delivering outstanding performance and power thermal efficiency simultaneously   battery life is every bit as good as advertised  i can charge overnight and use it all day without plugging in   connecting usb devices such as external drives will shorten battery life  but that s to be expected   i love the fanless design  which means the machine is absolutely silent at all times  while the thermal efficiency of the m  chip allows it to remain amazingly cool   in use  this computer feels very fast  especially with apps optimized for apple processors  as macos big sur is    interestingly  microsoft has been on board early with m  optimization  the latest office     version is smooth and fast on this machine   i also tried out ms edge on my new laptop based on a recommendation from another user and have been so pleased with its speed and efficiency that it s my current default browser   the touch id and apple pay capability is a welcome addition the only cons i see are minor in my opinion   because ram is integrated into the m  processor  post purchase memory expansion is not possible  if you think you ll need    gb of memory that model can be had from the apple store   there has been criticism of the fact that this machine has only two ports  which is fair   for me that s not insurmountable  i simply use a usb c hub to provide additional connectivity   i ve read recently that some users have had certain hubs cause problems with their m  macs  which appears to be related to battery charging through these hubs   to be on the safe side i use a built in port for charging and have had no issues reading through the relative handful of critical reviews  it looks to me like most  excluding actual defects  which happen with all products  are based on lack of understanding   for example  i saw a large number of reviews complaining that this machine  has no usb ports      which is patently false   in fact  its two ports are both usb  they just require a different connector   what these users are looking for is the old usb a connectors  which this macbook does not have  however  that s easily fixed by using a usb a to usb c converter cable  or with a usb c hub   usb a peripherals are gradually disappearing as well  in favor of the new connector all things considered  i really love this machine   the      price  at the time i bought mine  was      less than i would have paid at the apple store  and i believe i can probably get      on ebay for my old macbook air  try that with a   year old pc   leaving me with a total outlay of        considering that i ll almost certainly get   or more years use out of this model  i m very happy with my purchase and would do it again ,US,0.9959,positive
2694,the m  macbook air is my favorite portable mac i ve ever owned  it runs really great with the m  chip  battery life is seriously all day  i normally go for the most ram i can get  but went with the  gb as amazon had a sale and i don t regret it  can simultaneously run lots of browser tabs  slack  and all my other work apps with no sluggishness ,US,-0.274,negative

2697,i was a bit skeptical of everyone saying how great the m  air is  i ve been using a windows gaming pc with an i      k processor and    gigs of ram for audio production with a lot of amp simulators  processor intensive  and sample libraries  ram intensive   i needed to be able to create music on the go and i wasn t sure the m  was up for the task since desktop processors perform better than mobile processors  boy was i wrong  i reached more than double the amount of amp sims as my desktop pc could do and was still only at     processor usage  these arm processors are so much more efficient than intel so if you re looking to do audio production on the go  the m  is the way to go  i do wish i got the  tb or  tb though to avoid needed to keep an external hard drive plugged in though so get as much storage as you can possibly afford,US,0.8707,positive
2698,i had a      macbook pro that i used until       i then switched back to a pc until purchasing this m  macbook a month ago  i don t know why i haven t been using a mac sooner  having messages and facetime and synced with my phone  along with ms office functionality makes this computer a dream to use only issue i had was using a usb c to display port plug to plug into my monitor  worked great until the latest update of big sur  have an open case with apple and they seem perplexed  but a quick review of reddit shows this seems to be an issue with the m  chip  i ended up purchasing a usb c to hdmi adapter and have had no further issues  except being out     for the first cable ,US,-0.1027,negative
2699,this new mac is more powerful than all previous versions  runs silent  no fans   dissipates heat under the heaviest of loads with no throttling  and does so while lasting    hours on a chafe and being almost as light as your phone people taking about m  being an issue either don t know enough to figure it out or are straight lying  everything works fine if you re looking to upgrade  you can t go wrong with this ,US,-0.6258,negative
2700,i bought my first mac in      and my first     shares of apple in       no one could have dreamed what apple was to become  and i never believed that i d get a job working for apple  and add to those shares over the next    years through the employee stock ownership program  every   months  i get a dividend that s   times what i originally paid for those     shares  which have now become      shares through reinvesting those dividends which brings me to this review  the reason apple is approaching a   trillion dollar market cap is because they make the greatest products in the world  and everyone wants them  and i m writing this on the laptop in my review  and it s just an unbelievable value ,US,0.9186,positive
2701,i love this laptop  from the small apple logo that i see as a mirror on the screen part of the laptop to the keyboard  everything is awesome things i loved  battery is great  got it delievered around  pm and when i got home i immediately turned it on and it was around     battery  ive been on it all day night and its at     screen  the brightness it great  i can anything i want with the easy controls and i can the colors are so vibrant and pleasing to look at keyboard  i am one who is stuck in the keyboard hobby and i know what is and isnt a good keyboard  the one on this macbook is quite nice  it has a nice sound and feel to it  i love the amount of key travel on it considering it is a small laptop that doesnt even weigh   pounds speakers  i love that even with the first level of volume on i can still hear it quite clearly  the sound of the speakers is insane and that fact that apple even added the spekers to the sides od the keyboard too is even better  almost like surround sound design  i love the sleek and slender design of the laptop its so minimalistic and i love that so much  there isnt any big details on the outside or inside which i like   although this may not be a good part of the review as this is kinda based off of the buyers opinion s  tldr  the battery is very very good  long lasting  the screen is also very pleasing to look at  the colors truly do show themselves on this laptop and the brightness control is also very nice to have  the keyboard is very nice quality and sounds nice and feels nice to type on  teh speakers almost act as surround sound because they are on both sides of me and have a very nice output of the sound  lastly  the design is sleek and minimalistic and i love that oh and did i mention that the touch pad is also very nice  its like the home button on the iphone   and    it doesnt actually click it just feels like it which i happen to like too,US,0.9983,positive
2702,best laptop you can buy but mine came scratched idk why apple is trying to punish me for but it s fine  also be really careful because the screen is special  it has a coating for retina display and even touching it or gently cleaning it can remove some of the coating and leave subtle blue marks  sound is boxy i d recommend speakeramp and choose flat sound to get a clearer sound  but nothing is perfect of course and for that price this is a great investment,US,0.92,positive
2703,i just got my new macbook air and was super excited as it is my first ever mac computer  but it will not turn on  hopefully i will be able to return it  but either way it is going to be a hassle  a big reason i bought this was that i was tired of my windows laptop taking forever on windows updates and often being slow  but at least that thing can turn on very disappointed with this i thought one of the big selling points with mac products was that they  just work   when i first opened it after it arrived  it would not turn on  i figured ok  i thought they come with some battery life but i guess i have to charge it  it turned on once after charging it for a bit and then never again  after i went through the initial setup config i closed the laptop to let it finish charging  i came back an hour later and it would not turn on  i have tried charging it  i have tried plugging the charger into a different outlet  i have reseated the usb c cable and tried both ports  i have held down the power button for     seconds  i have tried hitting control   command   power  it doesn t do anything doesn t even make a boot up sound it just won t turn on  looks like i am going back to a windows laptop i have never had one that completely doesn t work at least ,US,0.4448,positive

2708,this is my first mac  it was not hard to get used to it as the laptop itself works great and has all the features needed  the battery life is extreme  way longer than i expected  it also charges real quick  nice that it uses a usb c plug to charge  it can be plugged in at any usb c plug  the only thing is that it only has two usb c ports  no sd or micro sd reader  i used an external seagate hard drive with my windows laptop and now use it with the mac  just had to download free software from seagate  the hard drive has   usb a ports that i can use to connect some of my devices that don t have a usb c plug  but this macbook air is super cool  the camera and microphone have great picture and sound quality  i have not even had a need to use my external blue mic yet ,US,0.963,positive

2715,i ve been using this computer for about   weeks now  hopefully i don t jinx myself by posting this review  but so far i ve not had any issues at all  the computer came in the original apple packaging and was ready to use within minutes  there is a noticeable difference in the ssd performance which now comes standard instead of the older hdd  load times are much faster and you don t get that clicking whirring sound you d get from an hdd  it s also incredibly light  so it s easy to take from room to room  great battery life as well  i don t plan to run any heavy programs like pro tools or final cut on it  but for web browsing  spreadsheets  and streaming movies it has been excellent ,US,0.9804,positive
2716,all forms of establishing this computer to the correct running system et al went smoothly except all the  passwords were defined in a not described format and the email program could not be connected as icloud had my email buried within the demographics it contained  it took two hours with apple to be able to send emails as the computer did not allow my google email to connect   however it is a very beautiful computer   wow   what a ride and an amazing thing to experience the apple representative and how he went thru each and every system   very interesting ,US,0.9369,positive

2743,i love my macbook air  i chose gold  it s such a beautiful classy color  it came in original packaging packed very safely  i haven t tried the camera yet i switched to ipads since      and haven t missed crashing windows one bit  i needed to do a few things my ipad wouldn t do a mac it was  the battery life is amazing  and the screen brightness is great  i ve heard it isn t bright as the macbook pro but i can t believe anything would be brighter  i can t put the brightness but half way up ,US,0.9595,positive
2744,i m absolutely stunned by this laptop  it s pefect in every way  super fast with incredible screen quality and the outside color  rose gold  is beautiful   it s extremely light and can be carried anywhere  i did get a protector because i was afraid to damage it since it s so light i felt like i could add a bit of protection so i put a clear plastic case and it still feels very thin and light ,US,0.8607,positive
2745,also i have been a microsoft user for many many years  i decided to take the leap for a new os and computer to expand my technology iq and support for a new os i am impress by the small footprint weight and especially the speed  resolution and ease of use with mac os big surf functionally  i would encourage anyone wanting to take the same leap  this the computer to start  i have evening carried over some my windows os applications  i e  office       it works,US,0.9136,positive
2746,in general i love this macbook air  i have had other apple products but this is my first laptop   it has a great display  it opens easily with touch  fingerprint  id  you can move easily from here to there and not lose any information  it is great for most purposes  the things i have had trouble with are the apple word processing  spreadsheet or presentation programs  so i continue to use office      that is not totally fair in this review as the device is wonderful ,US,0.9742,positive
2747,love apple  but wish it was easier to adapt and find thing after using windows for so long  i have to search in safari for answers  once  i figure out everything i will be much happier because it is so much faster ,US,0.9377,positive
2748,the macbook air is an amazing machine  i absolutely love it    i only wish that it had more ports on it  not a huge deal because i bought a hub for more ports  but would have been nice to see more ports on this thing  other than that  i love how responsive it is  and i love the picture quality  also  the battery life on this thing is unreal    i have left it off the charger for well over a week and have not needed to charge it  it is amazing   ,US,0.988,positive
2749,i love this macbook  the battery life is amazing and i have been able to complete work tasks easily  i love the size because i can carry the macbook when i travel without having to use a big laptop bag  the screen quality is great  but i had a little difficulty seeing the screen outside in a sunny area  although  when i found some shade i had no problems at all  i am not outside much in the sun on the macbook so this isn t a big deal for me  overall  great product in my opinion  it is perfect for what i need to do for work ,US,0.9534,positive
2750,i needed to upgrade my old desk top computer and synch it with my iphone   perfection   everything about apple is the best and this macbook air is delightful   there is so much more i can do and i can see the possibilities are endless ,US,0.926,positive
2751,i jumped from a      model macbook to thisi got the     fb  gb model i produce music and honestly it s been able to handle all of my plug ins and sound packs with ease   the touch buttons for the sound and brightness buttons are a much better practical way to go then the touch bar on the mac pro screen quality is solid and it s really fast and smoothif you have any doubts for buying this over the pro don t doubt it   it s extremely quiet and to be honest one music session i had was about   hours straight and the laptop was barely a little warm after all of that editing and recording on logic pro x    if you can afford it    it s worth it    the only thing i think that i m annoyed with it the fact that apple is still using a    p webcam    it feels really lazy to me that i m      they chose to go with a    p i think if they fixed that the laptop would be perfect,US,0.9124,positive
2752,i love my new apple macbook air  it s has a new operating system that i am getting used to  the machine itself is wonderful it reminds me of my g  and pro power tower the great grandfather and parent of my new macbook air  as soon as i get ps i will be dancing with my new toy and being creative again  my macbook air arrived in great condition and ready to go  i have been an apple girl for many years and love their products  thank you so much ,US,0.9821,positive
2753,this is one of the best purchases i have ever made  i truly love it  and believe it is the best air ever made  no plans to upgrade anytime sumer  truly revolutionary in the laptop genre  cheers apple ,US,0.9652,positive
2754,pros  i love the new m  processor  i had an i  macbook air before this one that was fast  this one is to me compares to the i  for speed cons  i don t like that you have to buy an adapter to have a usb or to use my camera sd card  plus they took away the magnetic cord you charge with now it is just a plug in like the macbook pro  being a computer tech i see problems in the future with it being a plug  they always seem to loosen up as the years go on  other than that i love it ,US,0.8934,positive
2755,not much to say  excellent product overall  no cons except lack of ports  all day  battery life  excellent screen  keyboard is good as well  i have the   gb ram version but haven t seen any lag due to it  use it often to run demanding simulations and it has not disappointed me so far i was little concerned with the m  chip and compatibility  however  x      runs well enough  though cpu ram usage is a bit higher  dropbox  for example   if you are using native versions  its far better than any x      mobile cpus on market ,US,0.853,positive
2756,we own a macbook pro but needed a second laptop to keep the marriage from going off the tracks   bought the macbook air and are very pleased   it s lighter than our pro  has similar performance  is a bit lighter and cheaper   the only negative is that its two usbc ports are on one side  makes it trickier to keep it plugged in our seating situation   probably not an issue for most   oh  the battery life seems better than the pro   definitely recommend it ,US,0.8334,positive
2757,its cool  running zwift just fine after downloading rosetta  i push through an older    p projector and i have the apple adapter for hdmi  non  k   and its crisp enough for me at this point  opted for the rose gold and it really added a special tone to the notebook  im happy with it self updating too  the fingerprint button is a big easy too  i think i ll keep it ,US,0.9132,positive
2758,this product is not cheap  it s not something that you normally could just drop loads of money on    good job if you can take students perspective  not much to my name and obviously in desperate need of something that can at least operate  sure you can opt for something cheaper if you want something that just  works   however  if you want something that can get the job done  is reliable  absolutely beautiful  and long lasting that can beat any other laptop out of the park with the m  processor    i d suggest you get this laptop now stop thinking about it honestly  just do it  two days ago i was sitting here debating for so long if i should even go for it finally somehow having the funds  regretting doing so even after placing my order  all that went away when i held this near magical product in my hands for the first time  you will never have to buy another laptop again for a long time if you simply take care of it  it s going to take me a long way into my education    as will it you and what you chose to use it for happy m  ing be productive ,US,0.9117,positive
2759,not much to say here that s different from what s been said elsewhere  build quality on point per usual with apple  feels as slick as ever  no problems thus far about app compatibility with the m  chip  as with almost all apple products  you can purchase with your eyes closed ,US,-0.5994,negative
2760,this is a phenomenal laptop and not just at its price point  the m  chip is snappy and fast  the battery life is amazing and the screen quality is excellent  all of that is bundled in a thin  light and quiet  fan less  form factor  i d highly recommend this macbook air unless you want to run high intensity games  they just aren t native to mac os and won t run as well as they will on windows  ,US,0.9565,positive
2761,this purchase for me was an upgrade from a old macbook pro i ve been using for over   years got a refurbished macbook pro      for christmas   years ago so i when i saw the      macbook air new not refurbished for     bucks i jumped on it and i m glad i did because it s a great macbook fast efficient i edit videos for youtube everyday and this macbook does it way faster than my old slow macbook pro so i m very happy a must buy for sure,US,0.9475,positive
2762,i m not really a mac user  but i heard a lot of good stuffs on youtube about m  macbook air and want to give it a try  guess what  i don t think any windows laptop around this price range can beat this m  macbook air  no fan  so it is quiet yet there is almost no heat  battery life is insanely good  if you are looking for everyday laptop around          bucks  this is it  highly recommended  however  if you play games alot  especially windows games   then this is a no go ,US,0.8569,positive
2763,love everything about my new computer except the bezelless screen compared to my older macbook air   on old macbook air you could adjust screen angel by grabbing the metal around the screen with out touching screen  now with no bezel i leave fingerprints all along outer edge of screen  this is a minor inconveinence compared to the battery life and m  processor that walks circles around      macbook air ,US,0.4215,positive
2764,product was broken,US,-0.4767,negative
2765,winner winner apple dinner   it is a gem   software setup cumbersome but once done   it kicks assthe trackpad lil stiff on clicking to select   guess breaking in will solve it   rosetta   had to be installed  so it can run intel based apps  if you get pop up    install it   had me goingbut for the money  it is fast  and installed new update   loads of preinstalled goodies   apple got this one right   the webcam they should have splurged on   they couponed out   but good enough    rd party apps will fix,US,0.9246,positive
2766,so my thoughts are on the m  air version and i must say its a great machine for the price it s my first apple device as i m a pc gamer but i had to have this because of the arm chipset being that it surpasses a lot of x   chipsets it s very impressive the battery life is by far the most impressive thing about it   nothing at the moment beats the battery life it s great it has a great ips display as well looks very vivid and sharp,US,0.9822,positive
2767,upon receiving my new mac  which i waited days for  i questioned the condition of the box   apple has very nice packaging but this looked beat up and worn   i did need to call technical support for something and found out by providing the serial number that my  new  mac air was already out of the    day warranty   i received a used computer   with the price i paid  this kinda makes my blood boil  this one is going back and i will get a new one in return ,US,0.4672,positive
2768,nice price bt pack had toxic black mold  not returning bc i couldn t smell anything on the hardware itself and i have stuff that needs to get done  advise looking somewhere other than amazon   if it looks too good to be true  it probably is  very disappointed ,US,0.701,positive
2769,i m a pc guy  not a apple fanboy  credit where is deserved though  apple does make nice if overpriced devices  it definitely has the best screen of any laptop i ve bought  the m  battery life and performance is quite impressive for a laptop for this size and price  keyboard is good too  points deducted for apple pulling it s usual crap     only   gigs of ram and     of storage  lack of ports too ,US,0.8781,positive
2770,what a great improvement over my old macbook pro  this is my third such computer  it keeps me in touch with the world and amazon  what bugs me is the razzle dazzle passwords i must come up with to access other sites which is why i use amazon almost exclusively there are so many goodies on this one that i will probably use only a few  though it is made for the new generation of users  great product  thanks applel,US,0.9477,positive
2771,i appreciate that the price was discounted for a great value   the package was secure and well packaged  which was very important  given that this was delivered via mail   no cracks on the screen   the processing speed is quick  which is extremely helpful   i appreciate there were instructions  in a small pamphlet  that explained how to transfer everything from your previous macbook to this macbook   a seamless transition is vital and means less frustration   this macbook air is very user friendly  especially visually   as someone who wears glasses  i appreciate the option to make the pointer larger  the ability to have more contrast  etc     that the user manual automatically pops up and walks you through enhancements and new features makes this even more user friendly ,US,0.9816,positive
2772,my first time macbook experience  there are many things to learn  my iphone and ipad  experiences helps  that is the apple system  its shares so many apps  functionalities  the  m  chip is amazing  laptop never got warm and i use it for three or four days without charging i have migrated many window office documents to mac  am still learning so far i m impressed with the new mac air  quality is top notch,US,0.9024,positive
2773,i needed to replace my      macbook air since it was getting slow and i m running low on storage   it was an improvement but is not perfect   price wise it is an excellent buy and a lot cheaper than other apple offerings   i was pleasantly surprised how easy it is to transfer data and applications using time machine with apple migration assistant   the display is outstanding  what i don t like is the lack of ports and no magsafe connection for power   and i prefer catalina over big sur but maybe i ll get used to it   also if you plan on keeping it for more than a couple of years and take a lot of pictures or movies     gb is not enough memory   get at least     ,US,0.9263,positive

2777,i got this for school after my hp computer s battery stopped working  it s really great for the price  the screen resolution is really nice and the touch id is a good add on  i really wish apple would make touch screen macbooks but they probably never will  it also doesn t have a usb port which is kind of weird  learning the controls takes some time but overall a great computer ,US,0.8966,positive

2781,i m giving this a   star because the laptop is perfect for what it is and the seller was great  however i watched multiple youtube videos glorifying the m  chip as being fast enough that  gb could handle a ton of open applications  i need a bunch of tabs open for my work  use canva constantly  and occasionally need to open photoshop too so i needed to return this and buy   gb  but that s my fault and the youtube reviews faults  not the laptop  battery life is amaaaazing though ,US,-0.2263,negative

3634,over the past    years  i ve had five macbook airs and three macbook pros  my employer provides a new one for my work every few years  and i upgrade my own at home every     years    most recently  my personal computer has been an early      intel quad core macbook pro and my work computer an early      macbook air   the brand new m  macbook air is my favorite by far  and fixes everything i didn t like about the macbook air   pro introduced in early      the m  mb air s battery life is amazing  i can use it all day and still have        battery remaining   my previous mb air and mb pro gave me around     hours of battery life  despite apple promising     hours    which was barely enough to get me through the day i m also loving the the fanless design  silent operation  and increased performance   even though i don t do much video editing  my workflow can be taxing on the computer   i regularly run lots of apps simultaneously  including zoom for teaching  many open browser windows  excel   statistical database software  and a connected ipad i use as a digital whiteboard when teaching over zoom   the new m  macbook air handles this easily  and does not get hot despite the lack of a fan   the mb pro i ve used since april  the one introduced in early      with intel quad core processors  also handles this load well  but it gets warmer and fans kick on sometimes   the early      macbook air buckled under this load  it gets very hot and the fans are screaming besides the better battery life  silent operation  and robust performance  the new m  mb air has a display with better colors and a slightly better webcam compared to previous mb airs the mb air s display doesn t get as bright as the mb pro s display   that has been true for years  but it has never been a problem for me   i would only need the display to be brighter if i were working outside on a sunny day  and i just don t do that i really love the keyboard on the new m  macbook air  which is the same as the keyboard on the early      mb air   pro  and much improved imho from the butterfly keyboards on the previous mb airs   pros   it is quiet and super comfortable for typing   when typing very fast  my accuracy is higher on this keyboard than on the butterfly style keyboards this is subjective  but i really prefer the mb air form factor   the wedge shape and slightly lower weight   compared to the mb pro   i also strongly dislike the mb pro s touch bar   i ve had two different mb pros with touch bars and they were nothing but trouble for me   when typing fast  my fingers would sometimes slightly graze the edge of the touch bar  which would trigger a command  like launching the music app   which would interrupt my workflow   i know other people don t have that problem  and other people find the touch bar useful  but it s just not for me for me  the mb air speakers  on this and on the previous model  are quite good for movies or youtube videos or zoom facetime calls   the microphone is perfectly satisfactory  though for zoom calls or when making my own instructional videos i usually plug in a cheap external mic which is a little better the webcam is still disappointing  even though image quality is slightly improved over previous macbooks the external design is exactly the same as macbook airs from years past   i like the design pretty well  but apple will redesign the mb air   pro in the next year or so to reduce the bezels which will allow a bigger screen without increasing the size of the computer   i will want one of those and might regret that i didn t wait but for now  the m  macbook air is the best macbook i ve ever had  it fixes everything that i didn t like about previous macbooks  except the webcam  and offers me a really great computing experience in just about every way ,US,0.9989,positive
3635, heads up  this review will be lengthy  but i wanted to cover every aspect to make sure you make the right buying choice  the macbook air has always been known as a popular choice for college students over the years due to the lightweight  slim design and good battery life  one caveat that has always plagued the macbook air of year s past was underwhelming performance due to underclocked  lower powered processors  which were always reserved for the  pro  line   that was why i always got a macbook pro in year s past  this time around  when apple announced the new m  chip  i was curious  so i watched hours and hours of reviews and decided to pull the trigger on the new air  the air has the same chipset as the macbook pro  with the same ghz at      while saving        i am on a budget  but i also didn t want to sacrifice performance  so i was a little nervous i was missing out by not getting the pro  but thankfully i have not had to sacrifice a thing i am a full time digital design student  so my workflow can be demanding at times with running adobe photoshop and adobe indesign  etc  i previously purchased a      macbook pro and it was my daily driver until about mid march when i made a grievous error and went out and purchased a lenovo yoga c    with   gb of ram  intel i  processor at a whopping price tag of           buyer s remorse soon followed as the yoga was plagued with overheating issues  thermal throttling and absolutely horrific battery life  the only thing that i liked was the speaker set up and the  k touch screen  other than that  i was beyond disappointed  i sent it back  and went back to using my      macbook pro  until i purchased this air so the pro s fantastic battery life i have a tough time killing the battery on this computer  it will easily last an entire day  and even longer if you aren t totally hammering this thing with demanding apps like i do  it s great to know you don t have to always carry a charger with you everywhere  you can carry from class to class  the coffee shop and back home and it ll still have battery to spare   a win in my book heat management and fanless design i am super nit picky about heat management and fan noise when it comes to laptops  which is why i always love the macbooks and detest windows  hence sending the lenovo back    the fact that this computer is fanless and manages to stay cool to the touch boggles my mind  i don t have to worry about a computer than will get so hot that you can fry an egg on it  or annoying fans kicking on  i also like that i don t have to worry about blocking any ventilation grills  since there is no fan  i can sit in bed with covers under this and not worry i m blocking a fan exhaust   again  another win in my book slim design at     pounds  and having a tapered design  you can throw this thing in a backpack and not feel like you re lugging around a brick  i also liked the tapered design as it s a little more ergonomic than my macbook pro that has some really sharp edges by the trackpad  it s a nice change for someone that has to type up essays all of the time keyboard gone are the butterfly mechanisms of macbook s past  one thing i really missed when i gave up my      macbook pro was the keyboard  thankfully with the new air and pro s  you get the scissor switch mechanisms back  so my fingers don t feel like they re hitting bottom when typing for long periods of time trackpad i love  love the force touch trackpad  i still believe apple has one of the best trackpad designs of any laptop out there  hands down  it s smooth as butter performance this is the little machine that could  it puts my      pro to shame  it also outperforms the lenovo that was supposed to be top of the line  at a fraction of the cost  i can have multiple tabs in safari open  photoshop  apple music  microsoft word  and this doesn t even break a sweat  i also like that i can do some light video editing on this  for most people especially college students this computer s power should be more than sufficient  keep in mind if you are a professional videographer or photographer  you might want to opt for the pro as it does have a fan and can sustain heat management better in terms of thermal throttling  again  that s if you re editing like multiple  k videos on a daily basis  but for college students or the average joe that may only need to do the occasional video project no problem  this computer can handle it screen it s nice and bright  and the color accuracy is on point  which is important if you edit photos or videos in any capacity like i do speakers i am a music junkie  and i have to constantly have music going when i m working on school projects  and for such a thin and light laptop the speakers on this are actually pretty good  good stereo separation and punchy  they could do with a little more bass  and when you max the volume it can get a little faded  but that s to be expected for such small speaker drivers  i am more than pleased with them  they also work good for binge watching shows on netflix the cons  there are few  the webcam it s a    p webcam  and well  it looks like a    p webcam  it s a little grainy and washed out  it will do in a pinch  but you d think in      we d get an upgrade on the webcam the lack of ports in true apple fashion  the i o is somewhat lacking  you have   thunderbolt   ports  of which you cannot plug in an external gpu  and are limited to one external monitor  this is a limit that apple s m  system on a chip  not the thunderbolt ports  which i am sure will be resolved in future iterations   i would have liked to have seen at least one usb a port for legacy things like flash drives  etc  but that s just me being nit picky m  chip running intel apps because apple s m  chip runs on arm and most apps are coded for intel  there are many apps that have not been optimized to run the new apple chip natively  like adobe creative cloud   you might run into a few glitches and hick ups while app developers are getting up to speed  so far  i haven t really run into any issues  but there is that possibility  i am sure here soon it won t be a problem  again  it s nit picking   to sum up  this macbook air is a winner  i would absolutely not hesitate to recommend this to anyone  and i would absolutely buy it again  you get the performance and the portability  while saving some   by not buying the pro line  i am very happy with this computer and think i might just have come as close as i can to the perfect laptop for my needs happy shopping

3636,this was the first apple laptop i ve purchased  my entire life i was so excited to always purchase an apple macbook macbook air because of the positive reviews  i tend to review most everything in the most positive light  but this is just horrible  i constantly come back to the laptop and it says  please report unexpected shutdown to apple   this has happened at least   times with no response from an apple technician  then the camera quality for a      machine is something out of the     s  it s horrible  i look grainy and i bought this laptop for an mba program  if you want to run many programs at once  even with upgrade ram and processor  you will hear what sounds like an airplane trying to take off constantly  the  fan  does  not  shut  off  sure it s portable  sure the  build  quality feels good in the hand  in terms of performance  spend the extra money and don t get this  i m quite embarrassed i shelled out over   k for this  do as you wish  but this laptop is not worth the money and has pretty much ruined my desire to get any form of an apple laptop again ,US,0.635,positive
3637,i love linux  i can tolerate windows  usually don t like mac  it s fine folks like what they like for me  linux gives the most choice is extensible  and runs so fast on even older hardware  you get infinite support you don t get harassed to use cortana  siri  candy crush itunes etc etc   mac usually they push you so hard in this echo system for a lot of stuff i really don t like  it used to be just getting music out of itunes was a pain well here we are in       i mainly work on linux these days  and wanted a unix style mac because working remote i just needed something with microsoft office  i need that  i am not doing windows development these days  i know there is wsl but there are trade offs on windows  not with mac     for my use case  so i tried it    gave it another shot really  my timing was seemingly really good  these computer are fantastic  you know what i hate about laptops  when they are     degrees melting your nuts and it sounds like you have a jet pack on  i hate that i really do  all of my laptops do this  the mac m  i am pleased to report doesn t  screw performance i mean that s great here  but the quiet and note heat that s the feature this is coming from someone that doesn t want to like apple  they outsource all these jobs  their stuff is over priced right  i m not so  sure about the price here  you can buy a mac pro    inch that s faster than an i  for       if you get   gb   and the battery is amazing  no heat  no fan  the sound is great  the screen is great  the keyboard is great  it s not a lenovo  but other than that it s about as good as you can get  this machine is so well thought out  i got the pro  the reason i take a lot of calls and wanted the slightly better sound  and boosted battery but if you don t need that you can just get the air which doesn t have the horrible touch bar  don t get me wrong  the touch bar would be fine in addition to normal keys  that s where they went wrong here they got greedy  i digress  the only other issue i see here is the connectivity sucks  it needs ports on both sides and at least  x ports all these reviews are usually full of crap  it s just people getting free hardware and writing reviews so they can take a tax deduction  or they are sort marketing  this time it s true  this architecture is a significant advance especially in the laptop space  i  m not sure if this will translate to a desktop   risc vs cisc isn t new it been going on for decades  but  for laptops  this is a quantum leap  i don t see any reason for the work i m doing to use a desktop computer a this point  i have complete portability  i can take calls  amazing calls   work on ms office  general development  vscode  all the jetbrains stuff  docker etc     i mean for a lot of system stuff i ll still use i d still use linux  but for work this is a great way to go  what a great product  it really really is  this i as strong of an endorsement i can give if you just need to be productive  after   months of hell no more fumbeling around with tpm chips  mics  no being able to share my screen  pleading with my computer to use the right audio device  i like it better than any other laptop i have ever had by far this thing is really just that good  i ve been i this industry for a long time  there are going to have to be some changes in competitors product lines  if apple continues to maintain this price point and deliver a product of this caliber  i have no question this one is going to eat market share fast  i d imagine there will be a strong response fro intel  amd and the software companies   it s difficult to justify purchasing any other laptop at this moment  i mean just get the air for       just get the extra ram  maybe     gb  that s all most people are going to need  who cares if they release better ones in   months  they always do they ll probably cost too much  this is all you need ,US,0.9972,positive
3638,i have both an ipad and iphone so i thought is would be make sense to have a mac so everything is in one ecosystem  as it were   to some extent this has indeed proved true and useful   i am coming from a surface pro     the mac air s battery life is much less than advertised   the claim is around    hours  i doubt i get    and i am mostly doing internet browsing and word stuff   battery life from fully charged was about   hour while on zoom   the battery life of the surface is better   word for mac is a little different than word for a pc  but the differences are minor and manageable   but documents open more slowly on the mac  and mine has the m  chip   on the surface  documents usually open immediately   on the mac it might take   seconds  not an eternity  but a little annoying   the surface boots up much faster than the mac   i have a dvd with a number of workouts on it   i could not get any individual workouts to open using the mac s native software   so i downloaded vlc   it works fine on the mac  but takes a long time to open  about a minute   this seems to be true of any software not downloaded from the app store  including firefox   there do not appear to be mac apps for either   on the other hand  the mac has a better screen than the surface   while the surface is quite a good laptop  it is a marginal tablet  and i almost never use it as a tablet   when i am not sitting at a desk  i prefer the mac because the two parts cannot come apart as can happen on a surface   the new mac keyboard works great  maybe a tie with the surface   so a mixed bag   as i mentioned  i like having everything in one ecosystem  so likely that is enough of a benefit to keep the mac   i am mulling over upgrading to the macbook pro    because of its bigger battery  but don t know if i want to spend the extra money ,US,0.9867,positive
3639,what happens when you perfect a product  you can only go downhill  in      apple perfected the macbook  then  they ruined it everyone in       it s great  a bit more battery life would be nice apple  we ll make it thinner  make the touchpad so big people hit it with their palms  remove the magnetic break a way power cable that everyone loves  replace all the ports with usb c ports so people have to buy dongles  swap the keyboard for one that barely even functions  and hell  just to mess with everyone  let s lower the battery life the      does little to fix any of the issues  it s a crap product  but after jobs died tim cook couldn t make changes because he d basically be admitting he was wrong  and they need to keep changing things because otherwise it is only perfect and not  new    whoever decided this was the way to go should be working in an amazon warehouse sorting returns ,US,-0.1154,negative
3640,okay so  pretty great laptop  it doesn t overheat  the camera is better than my previous macbook  and it runs pretty well  the only problem i have is that extensions like chrome keep crashing  as a student using google meet and zoom for   hours a day i really can t be crashing in the middle of a class  i m not big on tech  so i m not that picky  but i hope this problem sorts itself out ,US,0.8531,positive

3642,i am a life long fan of all things apple   that being said  after using this laptop for a little over a month  i am still impressed with how awesome this laptop is   the battery life alone leaves me in awe   i bought this laptop to use as an online student   starting with the battery fully charged  i am easily able to complete all of my online coursework and have plenty of battery power left to stream a movie or two afterwards   i actually purchased my macbook air m  laptop directly from apple so i would get the student discount   i did choose to upgrade my ram to the    gb for an additional       and that did cause delivery to take a little longer   totally worth it though   i have not done anything yet on this laptop to really stress test it  but i have had multiple webpages in the browser  and multiple documents open in word and pdf docs open with ibooks and preview   i have had no problems at all switching between open web sites  apps  or docs   the only time i started to notice any hint of a problem  it turns out it was because we lost power and therefore our home wifi was temporarily unavailable  so it had nothing to do with the laptop while it is a minor inconvenience that netflix is not available for download thru the app store at this time  oct        it is easy enough to access their streaming service thru the browser   the built in speakers are plenty loud enough  but it is quite easy to use your airpods if you prefer i highly recommend this macbook air m  to anyone  especially students  looking for a laptop that has a battery that will actually keep up with them all day long without constantly needing to find a power outlet ,US,-0.0662,negative

3644,i gave my wife this new macbook air as a gift   months ago  she is very careful with it  she opens it last night and the screen is garbled  there s a hairline crack in it leading from the left edge  it wasn t dropped  it wasn t pressed on  sat on  or kept under books  in other words it was normal use when the damn thing stopped working we took it to apple store and they want       to fix it  it s   months old  the guy says the display is flimsy and subject to crack  i go online to see if he is telling the truth    found a lot of hits of others complaining about how easily the screen cracks i m a big apple fan but am disappointed and outraged that apple would sell a product with such a design flaw and expect users to  buy apple care  so that they pay  less when it breaks     even under normal use save your money  buy and older model or get an ipad which ironically can take a beating by a    year old gamer without fail ,US,0.0839,positive
3645,if you purchase the macbook air with the m  chip you will no longer be able to run windows along with mac os   if your buying specifically to just use the mac os   don t have a problem not being able to run windows or any program that runs on windows  then this system is a good apple product   if you are like myself  or want the option like you should just have as has always been offered in the past with processors before the m  and run windows on a partitioned drive either with mac os  or boot up into windows instead  the m  chip now takes that ability to do so away   the macbook air itself with the m  chip now that they ve finally incorporated the ability to run iphone apps on it is in itself a huge breakthrough   that was overall my biggest frustration with using macbooks by a long shot   and it seems they ve fixed that now  so on one end impressive if your simply not needing windows or anything that runs in the windows environment of course ,US,0.8555,positive
3646,just bought the new m  and through a series of events and customer support prompts  i started out with   computer s and can now barely use my old one because it s too old to support macos catalina   mac pro late         super unhappy  not because the support wasn t excellent  because it was  rather because i was sent a computer that didn t know how to migrate data from one mac to the next  which is fully unacceptable  every prompt to fix this issue adds more time i ve had to invest in this problem and ultimately makes things worse  i ve been at fixing this issue since tuesday  it would be fine if the process hadn t bricked my old computer where  once i was running logic  can now barely open a pdf  i ve been thinking of moving out of the mac eco system for some time now and this will certainly push me on my way out of it  i ve not had the new m  computer for a week and haven t even seen the home screen yet  every one says how awesome the m  is  hopefully some day i ll know ,US,0.9243,positive
3647,i was hesitant to get a smaller macbook after my          macbook pro started to suffer from keyboard issues   i repaired the keyboard twice  so there must have been something wrong with voltage regulation to it anyhow  i couldn t resist the idea of an arm based macbook  so i went with the          macbook air since i don t think the pro model had apple silicon yet   i could be wrong on that long story short  it meets all my needs with flying colors   it turns out that i m perfectly comfortable with a     screen and that i don t need a bigger one everything great about this macbook   it s  fast    don t let the  air  moniker deceive you   unless you re into heavy gaming  this is the laptop for you   arm processors are the future of consumer computing   the battery life is  insane    i still can t comprehend how many hours this thing survives unplugged   i take it on flights across the country and never need to plug in or get worried that i will run out of power  even when i m charging my phone off it   it s slim and light   perfect for traveling   it is completely solid state with no moving parts   no fan whirring or anything like that   as an extension of the first point  it runs arm builds of windows insanely well with parallels   it can even run halo  ce at near full speed   macos is very stable   the retina screen is nice   despite what people are saying about the camera  it s actually better than the one on my old macbook pro    this isn t to say that the camera is  good   but it s adequate imo   all things considered  the m  macbook air is incredible value and really a great deal for the price   it has a larger touchpad than my old macbook pro but not quite as bit as the one on current     macbook pros   i find this preferable because it is just the right size where i m not constantly hitting it with my palm as i type   if you type a lot then the touchpad on this laptop will probably annoy you less while still having plenty of surface area   no touchbar     halleluja      decent sound from the speakers considering the size constraint there are some cons  but they are pretty minor imo   only the left side has usb c ports  in contrast to the pro which has them on both sides   the right side  does  have an analog audio jack  however  if that s useful to you   however  i ve managed fine without usb on the right side   it would be nice if i didn t have to click the fingerprint sensor button to get it to sense my finger and wake the system   on pros  the fingerprint sensor is always active   if you are one of the   people on the planet who want the touchbar  this will not have it   i however consider this a good thing   although the speakers have improved in quality since previous air models  the pro is still going to have better sounding speakers   you may feel like you ve gotten a bit of a downgrade in that regard if you are coming from a pro model   personally  i ve gotten used to it plus i use airpods most of the time anyway   the air does not have an hdmi port  but you can buy an  expensive  adapter that will provide hdmi   storage capacity is workable but limited   would be nice to get at least   tb of storage in the future   in the meantime i just back stuff up on to an external drive and periodically clear my downloads folder i m a software engineer and the m  macbook air exceeds my needs and expectations   i think i ll just be buying the air model in the future because it s terrific value for the price point        might be expensive for some  but i can assure you that it s a robust laptop so you are saving money in the long run   i ve owned many non apple laptops in the past and i ended up hating all of them   on the other hand  i never regret owning an apple device   this is coming from someone who formerly used windows and linux   i got tired of both the hardware and software breaking down quickly   apple isn t perfect    my last macbook pro chugged along for over   years until the keyboard repeatedly failed  but that still beats all previous laptops i owned that had numerous problems unrelated to how i treated them ,US,0.9952,positive

3649,before i begin  i d like to clarify that i purchased this macbook on apple com i was kind of reluctant at first to purchase a macbook due to the expensive pricing  but it was heard that apple products are long lasting and really good quality  i ve had  chromebook for   years  and the quality is not amazing  i ve had to bring it for repair multiple times  it also shut down randomly  but not with this macbook the macbook is soo beautiful  and sleek  the rose gold color is so elegant  and the keys are amazing  at the top right hand corner there is a small button that enables touch id which is so convenient and easy to work by just saying  hey  siri  my automated assistant is summoned and will help me with whatever i need  it comes with so many apps  and so many ways to customize your macbook i changed my profile photo  set a quote on my lock screen  changed my wallpapers  made widgets  changed my highlight color  accent colors and much much more it s so convenient for me to have my zooms open in one browser and the  pages  app open in another so i can take notes while my teachers gives lessons as shown in the pictures  if you update your macbook with big sur  you can download  widgetsmith  and customize widgets  my entire macbook s aesthetic is so elegant and i just love it  comparing this to laptops like hp and dell  as well as google  there are limited ways you can customize your laptop to your liking i asked a couple of friends and family members who have macbooks  and they have had them for    years  without having to take their macbooks for repair  i am hoping this will be my case as well i can now message anyone from the messages app and the mail app the camera quality is great too  it s touched up my appearance with zoom and google meet  and i ve heard if you want a macbook to edit  the pro is the way to go because the storage is bigger the battery life is so great too  i ve used it for    hours starting at  am to      pm  it started at    percent and it only went down to      buying a macbook will not water your money  i am loving every second of my use    thank you apple     ,US,0.9977,positive

3652,i very recently purchased  from the apple store  not amazon  a bran new macbook pro with m  chip  buyer beware     i ve been a mac and apple user exclusively for the last    years or so  i cannot express how bad this m  mac is  i bought it for work  professional audio  recording  live audio  protools etc   and it literally failed at everything that i needed it to do once i got back from a   week run on the road with a musical act  i tried to return the computer to the store  but to no avail  it was past the   week return window  apparently apple does not stand by their product anymore  they wouldn t refund me or even exchange it for a different model  with intel chip   so i spent       on a new computer that literally failed at all the work tasks that i really needed it to do and there is no recourse  not to mention that for       you get   thunderbolt usb c ports  because of this i ended up purchasing a high quality docking station        and still some of the features that i was counting on like the avb network protocol would not work on this m  mac  unless you buy    yes    apple adaptors to use in tandem   sounds like a rip off right  i ve literally spent days and hours on the phone with support from apple  windows  parallels  owc  kensington and at the end of the day the m  mac just isn t compatible with so many things i ve been a staunch apple user and fan for many years  but this experience might just bring me back to microsoft please stay clear of these m  macs and don t count on the apple store to provide you with excellent service  unless you are about to hand them over a few thousand dollars for a new computer that underperforms  for               for docking station and case  i got a bunch of disappointment  stress  frustration  literally the worst purchase i ve ever made regarding the apple store where i made the purchase  they apparently are in the business of taking a customer s money  but not in the business of providing said customer with anything else except a bad product ,US,0.7609,positive

3654,apple makes an incredible product  but their contempt for the customer knows no end  this is especially exemplified by the reduction of ports to only two on the macbook aires and even some powerbooks  and everything is put into those two  the separate power port is gone  the separate video out port is gone  in some cases  even the audio out port is gone  all they leave you with is two usb ports which they expect you to use for everything  for a lot of people  like myself  multiple ports are needed for constant use  they are needed for external hard drives  especially for file backup where you don t want to use the apple cloud which is susceptible to nsa snooping   external dvd and cd burners  special printers that do not work with bluetooth  special mice for people like myself with handicaps that make trackpads difficult  drawing pads  etc  etc  etc  and don t tell me to just get an external hub  i have tried them all and none of them provide proper power to external tools that need it  plus they frequently get hotter than a firecracker  in summation  apple needs to start giving consideration to the customer s needs and not just to some fancy  updated  technology  bluetooth does not work dependably and is a real pain most of the time and is not available for all external tools  we need physical ports  please put them back on the macbooks  especially the  aires   and stop taking them off of the mac cubes  the last one i bought had no audio port causing extreme problems with my video production work  please apple  bring back the ports  otherwise i may be forced  god forbid  to go back to microsoft computers ,US,-0.8402,negative
3655,apple used to make great computers    past tense  i ve used them for many  almost     years but recently bought this computer in december and my sentiments about this brand has completely changed  how the mighty have fallen i was always the biggest apple supporter  i have purchased many as gifts for relatives as well as bought them for myself  from the apple watches to the screens and desktops to the macbook pros  macbook airs and phones  i defended them against the apple haters and always had their backs  i thought i was going to be apple for life  i even own many shares of their stock  which i will be dumping soon because i see the writing on the wall  i could tell something was up with them as apple continues to have great earnings reports but their stock doesn t move  it s the biggest slug of a stock  i now think i have stumbled upon the reason why if you google the recent complaints about apple you will see  apple does not have the great customer service they once had  i was mistaken to think they did  they have also started cheaping out    big time  the result  products that don t last  couple that with customer service that could give a flying eff if you remain a customer of theirs and i m sensing a recipe for disaster unfolding here    selling all of my  aapl stock asap stat warning  do not buy this computer  apple s quality has gone wayyy downhill the macbook air cords are absolutely horrendous  i am on my third apple cord in less than   months  i brought the product to an apple store and the employee denied that there was any problem with their cords and instead blamed me  he told me i must be doing something wrong  nothing has changed about my usage of their products  i ve always used them the same way and never had issues with my cords until the computer was really old  think years and years  not months  so you d think if i was the problem like this guy tried to say i was  i d be going through computer cords right and left  right  well i haven t  and looking up my account would prove that  however  apple doesn t care  they want to charge me for to replace their defective products anyway welcome to the new apple where the customer is always wrong then the guy doubled down and told me that he d been working at the apple store for    years and i m the only person who has ever had a problem with their cord  a simple google search has proved that to be completely false  everybody complains about the quality of their cords  this must be huge business for them selling cords like this so the employees gaslight you and will blame you if something goes wrong  if you want to sign on for that  good luck  i hope you never run into a problem and see what i m talking about but you ll be fooling yourself because it will only a matter of time  i am done  i work too hard for my money and they aren t the only computer show on the road  lucky for me i speak pc too thanks for nothing apple  good job burning that bridge  you just lost a loyal customer over      hope it was worth the extra       it s not the money apple  it s the principle  i won t do business with companies who treat me like that  period  peace out ,US,0.8055,positive

3657,through the past year and a half  students have had to use personal computers and laptops for everyday tasks  most importantly being school  from my personal experience i believe that the macbook air      is the best tool for the job  if you plan to frequently use a personal computer or laptop in the future  the macbook air is the right choice because of its processing speed and storage  ability to keep a charge  and the apple compatibility that it uses first  the macbook air      is amazingly convenient to use throughout the day because of its ability to hold a charge and how quickly it gets charged  in my school days i did not have very much time to worry about the battery life of my computer  now i do not have to do that at all because i only need to charge my computer once to twice a week and its    hour charge  next  the apple compatibility that it uses  including apple music  imessage  facetime  etc   makes this product very easy to use while not having to use multiple devices to do actions such as getting a photo from your photos or getting that one picture from a text  this apple compatibility lets you see all of these things and not have to worry about changing devices to do so  finally  is the processing speed and storage  the macbook air      has a processor that is considered to be great for gaming and running large applications within the computer  this makes the computer amazingly fast while doing average school work and using it for everyday life  although it is expensive  the macbook air has been considered to be the best for its price out of all of the macbooks  including computers such as the macbook pro  the strange thing that the macbook has is amazing showing its slim appearance and lightweight feel  the storage that is available with the macbook is    gb     gb   tb  or  tb  but most went with    gb  these large amounts of storage are fantastic  showing that one of the macbook air s biggest competitors dell xps     only lets you choose between    gb and    gb  now if you want to have a large amount of pictures or apps on your computer that kind of storage just won t cut it  for these reasons the macbook air      is the best choice for daily use and school work because of its processing speed and storage  ability to keep a charge  and the apple compatibility overall  the mackbook air has the processing speed  storage capacity  battery life  and the apple compatibility to make it the best choice for a laptop or personal computer  throughout the last year and a half  i have had to be on my computer a lot to do school work and many other things  getting this computer has not only helped me do this quicker  but has improved the quality of my work because of its nice layout and convenience ,US,0.9922,positive
3658,i m new to macbooks  having used windows my whole life  i chose this for going back to school because i knew it would last longer and not get buggy like windows always does  while the transition was a bit rocky at first  now that i somewhat know what i m doing  i absolutely love this computer  it s small and lightweight  but still feel solid in your hands  the processor is incredibly fast as well as the load up time  i can get signed in and have my notes up in seconds  literally  no joke    something i could never do with a windows laptop  i should mention that i bought my computer directly from apple and upgraded to the   bg ram and more storage  which helps immensely with load up time   for those that say the camera is bad  i don t think so  is it the most amazing camera ever  no  but if you really need higher camera quality for your job  then you should probably go with a macbook pro instead of air  for a zoom meeting it works just fine  the price is obviously higher than many laptops  that s why i ve never used mac until now  but just think of it as an investment  i know i ll be able to use this for years to come if you are looking for an efficient  reliable laptop with great performance  look no further ,US,0.957,positive

3662,owned a      macbook air that had display issues from the get go  but apple said it might be okay if i was super careful handling it   i couldn t go without a laptop for   weeks so decided to risk it   after a couple yrs of being super careful the display became distorted after just a slight bump  and after the warranty period of course   used it hooked up to the tv only for about a year  but as that was difficult in itself  overheating  prevented sleep function  etc   had to change course   didn t wanna pay      for a new display  so   bought the m       macbook air instead  seemed to be operating well until   months in  when i wasn t even anywhere near it and the display went totally out   wouldn t turn on after repeated powering down so called apple   they had me power on with that shift control for    secs and it went on again  however  considering my experience with my last laptop took no chances and brought it in to apple they ran diagnostics and found that the ambient light sensor wasn t working   that s what automatically dims and brightens the screen when going into dark or bright places  in case you  like i  didn t really know what it did   had never dropped this or mishandled it in any way sent in my laptop for repair and it s now been more than a week without and they re still  diagnosing  it   luckily my old laptop is still semi functional if i hook it up to my tv   and i still had a few months left in the warranty   but what if it didn t and i didn t have the old one still functional two times in a row macbook air with serious display issues in the last   yrs  with no accidental damage from me  aside from this  has superior speed and processing power  doesn t overheat  but still takes       sec to power up and the touchpad functionality and the feel of both it and the keyboard are terrible when compared to the      i used to have if you buy an apple laptop now apple care plus is almost mandatory   will have to seriously consider going back to windows for my next laptop ,US,0.9599,positive
3663,i absolutely love my new macbook   when it arrived i answered a few questions  connected it to my wifi and off i went   it has been a buttery smooth experience   keyboards are one of those things that are dependent on user preferences  but for me it s the best feeling keyboard i have ever owned   many professional reviewers agree it s terrific  the multi touch pad is brilliant  and now that i know the many different combinations of fingers and movements i zip around getting work done   for example a two finger swipe right goes back to the previous web page  no need to hit that back button   it is also custom configurable to your touchpad needs  what i appreciate most is the total cost of ownership value   i bought final cut pro x when it came out    years ago yet there was no charge to get the latest version downloaded from the app store  it does everything i need without an ongoing subscription fee like others have   i still can t get used to how fast it works  it took me an hour to render a video on my old mac but this macbook did it in just a few minutes   and it s cool and quiet  i m using a huge      k monitor as my secondary monitor   battery life is ridiculous   i plug it in every   or   days depending on my workload  which is several hours per day   i think the web camera is fine for me and many notebooks use this same    p size   i join one zoom conference per week  so it doesn t really matter  the one thing i hope gets updated with the next release are the ports   i m using a hub because it only has two thunderbolt ports  i recommend this notebook to all my friends and family ,US,0.9928,positive

3669,first off i m giving this one star just so you ll read this honest review  i brought this mac book and have been satisfied with functionality and speed but i m giving   star because apple really nickel and dimes us as customers  the usb c cable that comes with the laptop is not even close to being one of the best on the market  i attempted to use it to power my elgato game capture card and the card would not read  kept saying i need a usb    to work  so i then used the cable that came with my samsung external hard drive and bang it work immediately  i spent a lot of money on this laptop just to receive a weak cable with it  the cable is literally only good for charging and light duty file transfer which i guess is ok for most people  but for me it was not  apple already doesn t give us headphones anymore and they don t even have the decency to give us a very good cable   star because for this price i could have built a computer or brought a prebuilt one  last apple laptop i will ever buy  o and the camera sucks and there are no setting to adjust it ,US,0.9317,positive
3670,i love this computer  just about everything is made so well on it  i have always been a fan of apple products  about two years ago when my old computer stopped working  i decided to get a macbook and would absolutely recommend this product  one of my favorite things is the size  it is so easy to carry or fit into almost all bags  due to the fact that i am an avid apple user  it is super beneficial that all my photos  passwords  and documents are so conveniently transferred to each of my devices  the only bad thing is some softwares are not supported within the apple computer which can be inconvenient for someone who may be a college student like me  otherwise  the computer is great for college students who do not mind emailing the teacher or going through some loop holes to complete the class ,US,0.9801,positive
3671,bad apple  battery always drop dead without any reason  sometimes  it is still     of battery  but it dropped dead in the middle of nowhere  or freeze  the screen just freezes    times a day at least  i have to force it to power off and on    times a day at least  i only have the mac air for    years  totally a junk ,US,-0.9148,negative
3672,it amazes me how much praise apple seems to be getting for an out dated design and user interface   where is the touch interface and pen input especially since it is supposed to run ipad apps   where is the flexibility of a   in   that we have had available for years   apple has basically given us a fast dinosaur with a pretty face ,US,0.9081,positive
3673,i encourage people who have had a bad taste left in their mouth by older  intel  macbooks  like myself  at least try out an m  machine in person and see the difference compared to my older core i  macbook  no more ridiculous heat and fan noise  no hit on performance with a bunch of apps open  and i could continue this list but  oh my god the battery   i will watch a few youtube videos  listen to music  edit some documents then check the battery percentage    to see it has gone down at most a handful of    on pretty high brightness  it s a remarkable accomplishment that will surely change the way i use and transport my laptop  app compatibility has not been an issue for me at all  but it s worth i do not use any niche developer   engineering tools ,US,0.9668,positive
3674,do not buy refurbished  used laptops from amazon  often times they are stolen and when you need software upgraded or fixed the manufacturer will not touch the computer when they figure out its stolen  amazon will not refund or replace the computer with one that is not stolen  so you are stuck with stolen goods that can not be repaired through the manufacturer,US,-0.9129,negative
3675,this macbook air  i think steve jobs would have a smile on his face if he sees it   so fast  so light  the battery can seem to last forever   you may think  for such a small volume  can they just put a battery it in  or just a screen and keyboard in it  no  they put the whole computer in it  and super fast  last super long on the battery   i have used computers for more than    years and i have to say  this is the summit of our civilization ,US,0.8442,positive
3676,granted i m coming off a mbp       dual core i   but this thing is read my mind fast   i keep quitting apps out of habit when you just don t need to   keyboard is back to pre butterfly goodness  sound is great  and with a dock like the anker   in   you will not mind the port count   garageband and imovie never miss a beat   on geekbench  these new m  units are surpassed only by the xeon mac   imac pros and the   core i  imac   same no go apps as catalina  so no real surprises   can t wait for more universal binary apps  it ll only get better ,US,0.9521,positive
3677,i got this macbook air for work  because my personal laptop is a      razer blade  and while thin  it s heavy and runs hot like gaming laptops do i decided to get a macbook air m     g for a work laptop  and had no real expectations for it  i ve been very impressed the quality is what you d expect from apple  sturdy construction  i love the keyboard  the display is solid and shows a depth that my other laptops never have  it has handled everything i ve thrown at it  zooms  huge files of client contracts  browsing of course  i haven t ever noticed it throttling due to a lack of a fan it s operating system is very user friendly too  some tasks that are a bit more difficult in a pc are astonishingly easy  honestly  i haven t even touched the razer blade in a few months  i will always have an apple laptop from here on out ,US,0.9544,positive
3678,as a gamer i must say although i love my computer it does not last anywhere near    hours  maybe because i am gaming  but it does not last     while i am gaming  when i am working or watching tv shows my battery also dies kinda fast  i don t like to use my laptop and charge so i let it charge normally but that s my only problem is the fact that the battery is nothing like they said it would be  but neither are our phones lol  other than that its a great light way  easy on the go  laptop that works very well for business  not so much gaming as the battery is low  may be just mine but its the one con i noticed ,US,0.9607,positive
3679,i did read the   star and   stars  but i m not convinced my hands are too big  mac air is too heavy  dead on arrival  can t install ios  i am sort of the it guy for my department in a company that was supposed to be hiring geniuses very capable  of at least keeping their computers running for my experience at work and elsewhere  i would rather trust apple and any computer manufacturer over the words of these reviewers seriously  a lot of people  are extremely capable of destroying a perfectly good computer in the first hour they put their hands on it reinstalling ios   soon after they just received the computer  if they broke it right out of the box  can they actually install an os  ,US,0.4398,positive
3680,overall  i love it  however  with that said there are some serious cons to consider before purchasing    terrible camera  super grainy  this is unfortunate for a time that the majority of us are working at home or are reliant on ft for communication    it s important to be mindful  and as most techs will admit  this is easily apple s worst m chip  it will only get better  in the meantime  however  this mac is super fast i use it for school  work  and casual browsing  if that s what you re looking for  i recommend it  if you re looking for the best of the best  wait until they fix this camera ,US,0.9715,positive
3681,i traded in my previous macbook air for the current version with the m  chip  i have only had it for four days and all i can say is wow  i didn t think i would notice much of a difference  but i am very impressed with the speed and the battery life of this new edition  i mainly use my laptop for emailing  paying bills  and web browsing  and i purchased this model instead of the pro because i don t edit or shoot videos  this model is perfect for my needs ,US,0.8732,positive
3682,i m a big techie and after seeing all the benchmarks had to get the m   it s truly a game changing processor  my wife and i love this laptop  there s a slight adjustment as i m a lifelong windows user but macos is intuitive enough that it s not too bad  i tried to make the switch with safari but it lacks profiles so i m on the brave browser  brave works great and have had no issues so far  i also use signal and bitwarden and both work fine apple really knocked the ball out of the park with this machine  the one true con is the crappy webcam  aside from that this is the best laptop money can buy on the market hands down ,US,0.9834,positive
3683,the      macbook air bigsur os is one of the newest computers on the market at the moment and one of apple s best designs  apple has had many macbook models throughout their many years of being the best electronic company  but the bigsur os has many features that other models and other company computers do not have  this macbook comes with high quality upload speed  all day battery life  and superfast memory  which makes it the best choice for any computer or laptop right now  for a student and any other user  upload speed is definitely one of the most important qualities on a computer  this macbook s upload speed is fast enough that it can be considered a gaming laptop also  it has an apple m  chip with an eight core cpu which delivers up to almost four times as fast as past generations  this m  chip is designed by apple designers themselves which other companies do not have access to  this bigsur is the quickest computer on the computer and laptop market which puts apple as the highest revenue electronic company  battery life is another quality that is essential to many people  especially a student in the year       many universities and high schools have switched to using mainly online tests  textbooks  notes  and activities  all day battery life is important because some students are using their computer up to nine hours a day with school  homework  and studying for tests and quizzes  this macbook uses lithium polymer batteries which provide up to    hours of battery life  these batteries also are good for the environment and conservation  these are the best batteries for computers because they provide the best life and are good for the environment  good memory and lots of storage are also crucial qualities of a computer  this macbook can be used for up to ten years if there are not any software problems  this macbook has eight gb of unified memory that makes everything you do have fast upload speed and responsiveness  having enough memory and storage is great  for example  a student or a teacher would need to save documents  projects  notes and many more things  if there is not enough storage to do those things that a student needs to do then things will end up lost and not recovered  a lot of storage is also needed for a gamer because there needs to be space to download the games and have room for any spontaneous updates that might occur  good memory and storage are important to many people and that s what makes the bigsur os the best computer on the market  the macbook bigsur has many pros that other computers just do not have and is a reasonable price for all the features it comes with  this model is an amazing choice for students  teachers  gamers  engineers  it workers  and anyone who uses their computer a lot  the macbook bigsur os definitely continues to be one of the top rated computers and gives users a big bang for their buck ,US,0.9977,positive
3684,the macbook air is a great purchase for a laptop  it has many new features that will be helpful for school and work  the laptop is affordable  portable  and has the new m  chip  the way the laptop is affordable is because you will be able to pay for it monthly so you will not spend all your money at once  you will also be getting what you pay for with its latest features  it is also portable because it is light weight and slim  this will help you carry it anywhere you need to and will be very helpful if you go to college  since you will be carrying from class to class  lastly  it has a new m  processing chip  this m  chip makes it better than any past macbooks  it keeps you laptop running smooth and fast  it also gives you long battery life  i really do recommend you purchase the macbook air  it is worth buying ,US,0.953,positive
3685,upgraded from mid      base macbook air  this thing is like    x faster  it is amazing  i got used to the usb c and bought a little hub that makes it a non issue  actually like it better since usb c is faster  battery life on my old macbook was amazing  this one is literally at least double that  pro tip do not use chrome on any mac or macbook it is energy and efficient and will kill your battery  took me a while to learn this   webcam is only bad part but all macbooks have substandard webcams compared to iphones  i got the base model and do not regret it one bet  i saved a ton of money on one less core and i do not notice a difference  heard its     or less   this thing is razor thin ,US,0.9062,positive

3687,macbook review apple has created many technological wonders throughout the time of the business  and the mac is no exception  i have had different laptops before highschool  like chromebooks  so i knew what i liked and did not like  after about two months of searching  i landed on the macbook   when researching which laptop to buy for highschool  i landed upon the macbook for its reliable battery  the great software  and the modern features brought by the macbook  like touch i d  and siri  the modern aspects of the macbook are beyond great  and serve many purposes that other laptops fail to incorporate  the first one is fingerprint recognition  when i had old laptops  i always had to remember every character of the password  and it was just a plain hassle  now  however  apple has a fingerprint scanner built into the computer itself  which i find extremely useful  between my school passwords  my home passwords  and other important information  that is a lot to keep track of  now  though  all i need is my fingerprint and i can get into all of my accounts with my fingerprint  also  the macbook comes with siri  a virtual assistant to do tasks and find different files on the mac  there are many different papers  files  and websites needed to keep track of  and finding all those efficiently is almost impossible on your own  but  siri makes it easier  to activate siri  all you have to do is simply say  hey  siri  and the assistant will appear  siri responds to what is said  so if i say   hey siri  find  review    from google drive   the document will appear seconds later  although the modern technologies of the macbook are important  just as important is the software  many laptops lack the software that a high end desktop would have  but this does not apply to apple s macbook  first  the mac has capabilities that of gaming desktop computers  safari is the mac s main browser  so what happens if for some reason i need to use google chrome  well  the mac has the ability to run not only two but three different utilities at once  google chrome  safari  and bing  also  the software of the mac allows you to also play desktop games when you want to  most laptops are meant for business or school  like the macbook  but not all of them can perform as well as the mac for games  sometimes  after school  i explore and test the limits of my laptop just to get a sense for what the max is  i expected the macbook to do somewhat poorly  but i thought that it actually did pretty well  another reason why the macbook is great is because of the battery  the batteries for every computer seem the same  but once looked at in depth  not all batteries are equal  the macbook has a very long battery life compared to another laptop  like a chromebook  when i first used my macbook  i used it without charging it until it needed it  how long did it last after starting at      almost one day with no charge  the chromebook i had when i was in middle school would need to be charged after about five hours of use  also  the battery uses an optimizing system  when the battery is below      the system turns the battery power done  and thus turns down the brightness of the screen  this helps to maintain the battery for a longer period of time  not only is the battery great  but for many other reasons this is the best laptop i have had  the macbook is a modern  efficient laptop for not only students but for all kinds of people  from the battery life  to the software and the modern features  the macbook is a great laptop to use  no matter who you are and what you do  the mac will change not only how to get things done  but your view of a laptop forever ,US,0.9973,positive

3691,the new macbook air with the m  chip is overall amazing  it s definitely worth the money  the all new chipset has turned the air lineup into a beast  my only complaint is the camera  apple has stuck to the same    p camera and claiming the neural engine makes it better  i m not convinced it s any better  and it s really a disappointment compared to other notebooks in its class  also  the inability to adjust the keyboard brightness from the keyboard  it s adjustable from the settings and easily accessible  but it s just an inconvenience  it s a petty complaint but for the money  this should be standard  it previously was on older models   aside from that  this notebook is amazing  lightning fast and the best battery life i ve ever seen  overall  if you re in the apple ecosystem and you re looking for an amazing laptop with all day battery life   this is the one for you ,US,0.9346,positive
3692,buyer beware  like the macbook pro pictured here  the screen of the macbook air often cracks within a few weeks or months after purchase  entirely without any misuse  the design flaw seems to be the relative inflexibility of the screen s lcd panel i ordered a mba  then returned the package unopened after reading relevant articles on  to mac and the discussion thread on the apple support site  with few exceptions  apple refuses to make the repair under warranty  the user s cost of replacing the screen amounts to half the purchase price ,US,0.6369,positive
3693,great out of the box  then slowly the battery life started decreasing  the constant hard reboots to get safari back up and running  inexplicably running hot  and crashing more often than a windows machine  simply plugging in the power adapter is enough to crash the system followed by the necessary reboot i firmly believe that apple will eventually get the bugs will get worked out  but for now look elsewhere or wait for either the m x or m  processors that will hopefully have this operating smoothly update  there are other emerging issues in safari  the keystrokes to italicize  command i  will randomly switch to opening up a new email message  and the keystrokes to convert text to latex   command shift l  now inexplicably opens the left panel  i am also coming into the known compatibility issue mentioned elsewhere ,US,0.6187,positive

3733,update          still going strong unreal has really smoothed out the bugs  this thing is an absolute beast  beats my old desktop easily i can run photoshop  unreal  lots of tabs in safari firefox  and background processes  all no issues  heck  i can even run a game with unreal engine going in the background  i ve rarely noticed slowdowns  and when i have it s always been a software issue  typically memory leaks  i ve abandoned windows    haven t loaded it outside of a vm more than a few times this year  don t hesitate to get this if you re looking for a new laptop update          well  i had some issues but i love this thing enough i m sticking with it i believe a  rd party usb hub killed the logic board and touch id for it  i had to wait about a month to go theough the motions  especially with the time of year  finally got my replacement back today and i m really happy unreal engine does not run well currently  it gets crashes and will freeze the computer  everything else runs super smoothly and i never have issues  really happy with the laptop initial post let me start this off by saying i was very skeptical  lifelong windows user  i ve only had an ipod touch        and very briefly an iphone    i think   i also have pretty demanding needs as far as day to day laptop use goes this thing has handled everything i ve thrown at it so far  the only drawback is that my current model only has  gb ram  but if you re conscious about what you have open it s not an issue  even with more intensive programs like photoshop or unreal engine    neither of which are even optimized for the platform yet  which as stated in the title  is really impressive gaming has been equally impressive  to be fair  i haven t thrown a next gen game at it yet  but i threw games that i thought would be able to max it out  nope  civ    borderlands    and oxygen not included all ran at ultra with fps staying at steady     in each game  even in more intensive portions of each game  i m not saying it ll be able to play every game at ultra  but it s definitely been able to handle more than i though it would  it almost seems to be outperforming my desktop  which has an i       and a    ti  i think it might if i had the extra gpu core and   gb ram  which is crazy for a laptop at this price overall  it s worth every penny  i could rant about all the small features that make the os amazing as well  but you can find videos of that online may already be familiar ,US,0.9954,positive
3734,first let s start with the overall look of the macbook air  it s thin  sleek and super light   i got the gold color one and it took me a while to decide between the silver   gold  but after receiving my gold mac  i m so happy i went with it  the color looks so much better in person  it seems to have more of a rose gold color in person but if you take a picture of it  it looks gold i use my mac for some web searching  emails   when i do so the battery does good  and if i m doing some photo editing and downloads it dies faster  i spent all day on it and it does not get hot  so that s a plus  i don t feel like i have to give it a break i got the standard memory and just got a hard drive to upload my photos on there   if needed now the camera  it s terrible lol but that doesn t bother me much because i won t be using or doing any zoom calls  but i wish apple would make it better since it s not a cheap lap top i also came from not having a lap top  so far is perfect for me and what i use it for  i love that apple connects everything for you and it makes it that much easier to see emails  txt   calendar etc      i also love the vibrant color and sharpest of the screen ,US,0.9955,positive
3735,the first one i received got bricked trying to restore after the initial setup failed the second one is fine you can google the issues apple support said i d need to bring the first one into the apple store for a firmware update to get it working not great for a brand new       laptop anyway the second one came already updated and everything has been fine so i m happy now it s snappy and has that new macbook smell ,US,0.6856,positive
3736,no problems with the mac air  easy to transition from my old      macbook pro  i also bought an external hd which was cheaper than upgrading from old     to      my warning is about office       there was stuff on the web that      would not work  needed   bit  but while there seemed to be workarounds  i just upgraded and bought       there is a scam site posing as microsoft office setup that looks legit once on it  but you get an error message and phone number to resolve  after half an hour he explains that it is the firewall and can fix it by downloading one costing only hundreds of dollars  the url isn t microsoft but rest looks like it  while i didn t fall for it  it is preying on the few who might  so thought i would mention it  the mac is good and worth upgrading especially if  as with mine  hardware faults are developing in old one ,US,-0.3919,negative
3737,pros  battery life     stars  this machine last all day and i don t even know howscreen      x     in a    inch screen is remarkablelook  it s apple so i got nothing to complainsound  you can hear this from your bathroom with curtain and door closedheat  does not have any fan sound and heat problem at all  this thing is quiet    keyboard  no more butterfly keyboard cons  apple got the same deal for student but they attach free airpod so sadly i have to return this to amazon so i can that dealsmuge spot due to fingerprint or sweat on keyboard is unavoidable and very annoying to look at but i guess it is what it is all in all  i highly recommend this to any college student especially comp sci major to buy this  i was always a window users except for my iphone and i also have a fair share of laptop from gaming to everyday but this m  laptop right here beat everything else at this price point ,US,0.5966,positive
3738,this laptop is very good for students and people wanting to do basic work as well as people who are going to have this laptop under extreme loads  i ve ran heavy games and video editors and its done amazing  it s even beat some of my other        macbooks  it s very light weight       pounds   and is very thin but yet durable  it doesn t feel cheap like some laptops at this price point  it feels very premium with the metal body and soft keys and the retina display  the track pad is very large for the size of this laptop  i also love how it s fan less so it never makes any noise which is another reason why it s good for students    video calls  etc    my one and only complaint is the camera quality  it looks nice if you have good lighting but if you re in bad lighting it looks like a potato filming  but if you can get passed that it s great  i also love how the keyboard is backlit  it helps a lot if you re in a dark environment  the screen is also very good  it s nice and bright and has amazing colors which is very good for photo editing  the package even came several days early and shipped very fast  although the costumer service isn t very good  they didn t answer the questions i messages them about    i ll try to answer some questions i had   it does come sealed in the original apple packaging and it does have the m  chip  all around i highly recommend this  it s amazing for the price tag ,US,0.9978,positive
3739,i ve been using mac laptops for    years  yes before there were macbooks  and this is my favorite yet with this macbook air i m coming from an   year old macbook pro  in comparison  it is super light  feels like carrying a book great feeling keyboard fast excellent battery life beautiful display overall  i am more productive and happy since i started using this macbook air  when i first got it there were some bugs but perhaps they fixed them in big sur  it s been   months now  smooth sailing  cons i hate apple so much for changing the usb port  you need to buy an adapter for any external drives with the standard old usb cord to work  i bought a beautiful cover for my macbook but they didn t plan for the fact that many people would be plugging in a long adapter so i have to take the shell off  did i say i hate apple for doing this ,US,0.8549,positive
3740,back in      i got a macbook air with  gb i  and a turbo    back in the day it was the most equipped    i believe it was slightly faster in the kickstart by   or   seconds    yet back then i also paid about      usd  my video card broke at some point back then and i was a bit upset that my only option was to replace the whole mother board  so i kept it broken and fixed it a couple of years later about about     usd and it worked decently for an extra couple of years for basic work   i then got an asus with   gb plus  gb just for video as i wanted it for video editing  but it has  tb       ssd so the computer is massive and heavy and it has a cheap unresponsive trackpad making it so inconvenient to travel or work at a coffeeshop  so eventually i am back with mac for editing my website  answering emails  and all the other trials and tribulations of work    it is so refreshing and made me realize how much i missed this system as well ,US,-0.8484,negative
3741,i m new to the mac world  at least since the early days in the   s  so far it has been a pleasant experience and i like the stock software and layout  i haven t really had to purchase any additional apps to be able to do the things that i ve become accustomed to on pcs  so there is a nice learning curve  i do have a couple of constructive criticisms  that are not specific to the macbook air  though  in the future  i d like to see touchscreens included on their laptop models  being a former teacher of persons with autism  they really benefit from the additional input method   also  the retina display is awesome  but maybe in some of their higher priced laptops like the macbook pro they can start using oleds as model upgrades  other than that i m a fully satisfied mac devotee now  though i still love my pcs  ,US,0.9797,positive
3742,it s a great computer   is stupidly fast   the battery last for    to    hrs on constant use   if you don t use it that much last for days without recharge   it behaves like a smartphone but just bigger to fit a full keyboard and a big screen  with the same or better performance   this is the new era of laptops and desktops  you ll see soon other brands doing it too   because it uses  no fan at all   is very thin and lightweight   i don t need to use an egg carton on my lap to avoid overheating like the fan ones  the m  ship is definitely a great upgrade   excellent idea   ,US,0.9821,positive
3743,i love everything apple did to update the air  it s  by far  the best laptop you can buy right now  that s especially true if you were a mac user before  i wasn t  so i had to learn where everything was and what not  but it didn t take to long the battery life is phenomenal and i have had   issues with the thermals  when apple said it would cool passively  they weren t lying  i ve had     programs running simultaneously and it was obviously warmer  but nothing compared to any other laptop i ve used  the fact that it s dead silent when running is a nice perk as well i like how they kept a lot of the tried and true design on the outside because i don t think many people saw anything wrong with it to begin with the screen has amazing clarity and  in true apple fashion  all of my apple devices connect seamlessly absolutely the best laptop one can buy right now ,US,0.9812,positive
3744,zoom calls perfect and beautiful  video quality is excellent   performance is amazing   running parallels and windows    preview  screen looks beautiful   movies look amazing   audio is loud and sounds spacial   battery lasts easily all day and sometimes two days blows away my      macbook air   blows away my      macbook pro   don t miss the touch bar ports are enough   but wish there was one on each side as perfect a laptop i have owned and this m  macbook air run windows     i use parallels and windows runs super fast and looks amazing   no impacts to battery life   i saw some reviewers say it won t run windows and this is not true ,US,0.9874,positive

3749,i ordered the space gray version and it s beautiful  i ve owned an older version of macbook air and this one is def faster  not really sure if m  has something to do with it or maybe because it s fairly new lol whether or not it s fast  i m still keeping it  if i kept the old one for   years  this version will be just fine  i m sure it s faster and better altogether ,US,0.7931,positive
3750,i ve owned my fair share of laptops and let me tell you   nothing even comes close to this  spectacular battery life  incredible display  tactile keyboard and haptic track pad with all its  gestures and features which makes multitasking a wonderful experience  to top it all off  big sur  os  wraps it all up and makes your workflow the greatest pleasure  only thing i would change is the camera  it is decent in a well lit environment but struggles in the dark  putting a bigger sensor is a hardware limitation and i understand that  having a display this thin comes with its  sacrifices  if i could give this laptop    stars i would  don t hesitate on purchasing it  you won t regret it ,US,0.4854,positive
3751,i love the battery life  it lasts so long that i charge it sparingly  i love the instant on feature when i lift the lid  i am impressed with the biometric scanner that allows me to log in without my password  the macbook air allows me to log in with my apple watch as well  the speed is fantastic  i am thoroughly impressed  i have an m  mac mini as well  i am hooked ,US,0.9698,positive

3754,i hate that this laptop doesn t have a usb a port  i can t sync my iphone  ipad  anything that uses a usb a port  it only has two usb c ports  which doesn t help me  very disappointed  i had to buy an adapter but that doesn t work either  i m at my wits end ,US,-0.4012,negative
3755,still learning some of the new features  not sure if i like it better than the macbook pro  it is slow to come on at times and sometimes has to be fiddled with to get it to come on  screen quality is good and speed is improved  touch sensitive keys are taking some getting used to ,US,0.703,positive
3756,i decided to treat myself this year to this  ordered it on the apple website and was told     weeks  i ordered it on amazon and it was here in   days for the same price  love this  as for the product     you can not go wrong with apple  i was a little shook by the price but its worth every penny ,US,0.7829,positive

3810,after years of using nothing but pc laptops  the m  chip compelled me to try macs  and let me tell you  the hype is justified  the new silicon macbooks are simply incredible  the arm based silicon chip is so amazing that i was able to forgive the laptop for its downsides  which are the    p webcam  lack of sd card slot  and not being able to upgrade ram or ssd  despite these drawbacks  the battery life is insane and the machine is completely silent because no fan is needed since the laptop is so heat efficient  you re also getting a powerful laptop that outperforms the vast majority of windows laptops in the market  to top it off  you get a touchpad that puts other laptops to shame  a beautiful aluminum design  and build quality that will last  well done apple ,US,0.9699,positive

3834,i really wanted to love this laptop  i ve had only macs for years  this was supposed to be an upgrade from my      macbook air  i previously had a          intel based macbook pro for work configured with two hp monitors  no issues with the monitors and connected instantly with zero effort to get the screens to work with the laptop  bought this one and connected to my belkin hub for the hdmis  would only connect a single monitor  googled the issue and found that the new m  apple chip only supports a single monitor  news to me and i guess i should have researched more  however the low rating stems from the fact that this is a pro laptop  a professional would want two monitors and should not have to google whether a pro laptop supports more than   monitor when the intel version does seamlessly  despite this i had planned to keep it and just deal with   monitor because of the cost savings over buying the intel based macbook pro and wanted the longer battery life  now brings me to the issue that made me return the laptop  this laptop just would not configure to show a clear resolution with my monitors  the scale was off and the display just stayed blurry no matter what setting i changed it to on the monitor or the laptop s settings  tried and tried and just gave up  returned this and ordered an intel based     macbook pro  no issues  supports dual monitors  and seamlessly integrated to the laptop  no blurry screen and no having to set or change any settings to get it to work  i am floored that apple would produce a pro for business that only supports a single monitor  i love apple but will not buy anything with their chip until the kinks are worked out ,US,0.6577,positive
3835,i am an apple guy  i converted from pc        and have loved every apple device until the iphone x and the new macbook with m  chip  where to start  first  as is a major complaint for everyone  the macbook pro has all of two ports  yes yes  i know  this was listed in the specs  it doesn t make it ok   if i need to be plugged in  i have   port remaining  it is incredibly idiotic that i have to buy a dock to expand my ports  oh and the ports are only thunderbolt in apple s continuing stupidity of forcing the market to adopt its garbage  i did not buy a mac air for a reason  yet the macbook pro comes with all the limitations of an air  the new charging cable lacking magnetic attachment makes zero sense  the track pad is beyond finicky to the point of being useless  i have no bluetooth connectivity  i get incessant windows telling me to log into podcasts or apple music  i see zero performance improvements with the m chip  in fact  doing a side by side video recording with quicktime  all parameters equalized  i have a severe lag with m  mac  but not with the intel driven machine  and the touch bar is about the worst idea ever  i constantly dim the back light  or go back on web pages because of it  absolute trash  i bought this computer for work and will be designating it as a laptop for our interns  because that s how terrible it is  i will not be duped into replacing this hunk of garbage with the forthcoming macbook pro in which the port and charging issues have been fixed so now begins the massive switching costs for foolishly demonstrating brand loyalty to a company who has none for its customers ,US,-0.7749,negative
3836,update        a few updates now have made the pinwheel subside quite a bit  hope that future updates will make it go away for good previous i constantly get the pinwheel when switching between programs i e  explorer  outlook  teams  amazon music  notes  etc  these are not high power requirement applications  it is especially bad when docking and undocking from my workstation   i have my previous macbook pro setup exactly like this model and it powers through without issues  the problem has gotten so bad that i have momentarily switched back to my previous one until apple gets the software figured out with some updates  disappointing ,US,-0.0643,negative

3841,macs use to be quite a great computer  however  this computer tends to crash with certain programs  adobe and blender   no ports for sd cards  or usb   i bought numerous external ports  spent at least     on numerous devices  and still i am always forgetting them  i would at least love this feature to come back and or will to pay extra for this feature   this is probably fine for most users but for anyone working with arts  graphics and using different programs etc  this is a real inconvenience  mac has continued to make its products less compatible with other computer brands   overall this will be my last macbook  the drop and drag  and numerous features that made this a great computer and easy to use  were awesome but are no longer worth it  oh yeah  also i lost numerous movies that i had purchased off of my itunes  i contacted the itunes customer service and no help   pretty much i am sad  and frustrated and constantly trying to bend around apples new rules  like not only needing memory space on the computer  which mine is not full  but my icloud is full  after only   or   months of use and they want me to pay a monthly fee to save projects even on my desktop   so i watched a youtube video to remove icloud saving features because its pointless  and took numerous of my projects in progress and changed them  so now i changed it back and it rearranged my whole desktop order and i can not save any video files on this computer or any other project on my desktop  apple has been a throne inside and i caution those who are working on arts  coding etc  to save the stress and frustration and stray away  this computer is pretty much an ipad for people that don t want ipads   ,US,0.9803,positive

3848,i left my brand new m  macbook pro in my car for an hour and now the screen looks like a picasso painting   both amazon and apple refuse to pay for repairs because apparently this is considered an accident rather than a manufacturer s defect  even though i bought it only two months ago   so i m out      to repair a two month old computer   i would heavily advise against buying one of these  because if this is considered normal rather than a manufacturer s defect  then    degree heat is enough to damage the screen   this means that they re essentially useless if your air conditioner goes out and you will be left with a repair bill that is half the value of the computer ,US,-0.872,negative

3852,my laptop lasted less than   months before it died  i talked to an amazon rep who was responsive and put me in touch with an apple rep  who was curt  he suggested bringing it to a local shop licensed by apple to diagnose and repair  but he said they didn t have an appointment for almost a week  at the shop  they were much more responsive but warned that a small crack in the bottom of the screen that happened when i close it one day likely caused the problem  would not be covered by the warranty and would cost      to fix   fingers crossed it is something else  but he said he was    percent sure this would be the case   two issues with my      apple macbook pro with apple m  chip     inch   gb ram     gb ssd storage      debris can fall into the seam between the keyboard and screen unseen and    i kept having to adjust the brightness  even though i set the screen to be bright  it kept returning to dim  my other complaint is that the apple rep was curt  the tech at the shop said he sees a lot of screen issues and highly recommended by the warranty plus plan  which costs over       for two years  i think  and then      year ,US,0.7575,positive

3899,owned a      macbook air that had display issues from the get go  but apple said it might be okay if i was super careful handling it   i couldn t go without a laptop for   weeks so decided to risk it   after a couple yrs of being super careful the display became distorted after just a slight bump  and after the warranty period of course   used it hooked up to the tv only for about a year  but as that was difficult in itself  overheating  prevented sleep function  etc   had to change course   didn t wanna pay      for a new display  so   bought the m       macbook air instead  seemed to be operating well until   months in  when i wasn t even anywhere near it and the display went totally out   wouldn t turn on after repeated powering down so called apple   they had me power on with that shift control for    secs and it went on again  however  considering my experience with my last laptop took no chances and brought it in to apple they ran diagnostics and found that the ambient light sensor wasn t working   that s what automatically dims and brightens the screen when going into dark or bright places  in case you  like i  didn t really know what it did   had never dropped this or mishandled it in any way sent in my laptop for repair and it s now been more than a week without and they re still  diagnosing  it   luckily my old laptop is still semi functional if i hook it up to my tv   and i still had a few months left in the warranty   but what if it didn t and i didn t have the old one still functional two times in a row macbook air with serious display issues in the last   yrs  with no accidental damage from me  aside from this  has superior speed and processing power  doesn t overheat  but still takes       sec to power up and the touchpad functionality and the feel of both it and the keyboard are terrible when compared to the      i used to have if you buy an apple laptop now apple care plus is almost mandatory   will have to seriously consider going back to windows for my next laptop update              it s not only the hardware that has gone downhill  but their customer service as well   apparently  when i brought it in to the apple store to be sent for repair  the serial numbers were mismatched somehow that resulted not only in at least a week and half delay  will be receiving my laptop    days after i dropped it off  but i had to spend   hours with customer service  including a two hour phone call  yes  you read that right  where i talked to a tech manager who said the mismatch in store was the  st time he s ever seen that in    yrs   and the ambient light sensor failing in a macbook  usually happens in phone  is something he almost never sees  too   so either i was extremely unlucky or  more likely  the quality of both their hardware design q a and their customer service has gone precipitously downhill and to top it off  was chatting online with one of their customer support reps  who first informed me of the mismatched serial numbers   i then briefly voiced a couple of reasonable questions on how this could have happened  without being rude  and then this rep then completely ghosted the next    comments i wrote over    min   think that s the first time i ve ever been ghosted in a customer service chat the one thing i never really had questions or concerns about apple in the past was its competency   that s obviously not the case now and i m most likely going back to android for my next phones and tablets  as well ,US,0.9812,positive

3926,at a time when so many people are working at home  to release a new laptop that only supports one external monitor is absolutely absurd   everything else works fine  as you would expect with an apple product   so i am back to using my      macbook until apple gets their act together  very disappointed ,US,-0.024,negative

3933,if i could go back i probably would though past the time now i d say i m computer savvy  spent years of time on windows programs  photoshop etc  now that my current dell inspiron is reaching the end of its life  i followed all the great reviews and purchased this macbook air m  everything is hard  i actually loved my dell in many ways  though hopefully its life  around     years  is about half what this mac will be things i m missing the most so far  a touch screen  the ability to fully open ie fold back and flatten the rotation the screen  even the fact of needing to use   fingers to take screen shots instead of an allocated button  the delete button is actually a back space not delete button  notifications keep coming in upper right corner  blocking what i might want to access there  one needs to go through each app to change the setting btw  there s no default to say do not show notifications  it would at least be good to have the option to change the location of where they show up  i much prefer chrome to safari  though found on reading that chrome eats up a lot more power  i downloaded flotata this morning which is supposed to help though i haven t tried yet  incredibly frustrating especially when time is very limited  trying to figure things out   have spent hours on calls with apple support which thankfully is very accessible  but my computer seems glitchy  sometimes the screen sharing doesn t work  i haven t purchased a mouse as yet for it and also finding  right clicking  with   finger tapping to be frustrating and not working as i d expect it to overall unfortunately not a happy camper  maybe for mac users it may be a good machine for whatever reason i was also very torn whether to get the   or   gb  i went with the    i don t think that would make a difference at this early stage of being new i also tried to have my teen daughter  who s used to macs  give me tips though she was t terribly helpful so i watched a couple of youtube vids which gave some guidance  things are not intuitive i don t like posting negative reviews  though sharing this in case others in similar situations ie needing to carry on with trying to get things done  while their windows laptop is reaching the end of its life and needing to choose a new machine  may find this helpful also as an fyi  i had to pay an additional nearly      to have my   external hard drives transferred onto a new mac compatible one  so i can access all my previous work wishing everyone better luck ,US,0.8367,positive

3936,this was the first apple laptop i ve purchased  my entire life i was so excited to always purchase an apple macbook macbook air because of the positive reviews  i tend to review most everything in the most positive light  but this is just horrible  i constantly come back to the laptop and it says  please report unexpected shutdown to apple   this has happened at least   times with no response from an apple technician  then the camera quality for a      machine is something out of the     s  it s horrible  i look grainy and i bought this laptop for an mba program  if you want to run many programs at once  even with upgrade ram and processor  you will hear what sounds like an airplane trying to take off constantly  the  fan  does  not  shut  off  sure it s portable  sure the  build  quality feels good in the hand  in terms of performance  spend the extra money and don t get this  i m quite embarrassed i shelled out over   k for this  do as you wish  but this laptop is not worth the money and has pretty much ruined my desire to get any form of an apple laptop again ,US,0.635,positive

3945,i had a mac air for the last   years worked very well   although a little slow on the upload download times but it was a rugged stout machine  the new one has already been repaired because of the track pad a a few keys sticking the track pad is awful as you can hover over it and it engages and sends without touching it and when you want to send it sometimes takes several clicks  changing the settings causes it to slow down and delay transmission and there isn t a happy medium   i have become used to it but when traveling in a car or plane it s obviously flawed  also upload   receiving times a mediocre at best score  i would pass till they work out the kinks in a couple of years ,US,0.8909,positive

3974,i very recently purchased  from the apple store  not amazon  a bran new macbook pro with m  chip  buyer beware     i ve been a mac and apple user exclusively for the last    years or so  i cannot express how bad this m  mac is  i bought it for work  professional audio  recording  live audio  protools etc   and it literally failed at everything that i needed it to do once i got back from a   week run on the road with a musical act  i tried to return the computer to the store  but to no avail  it was past the   week return window  apparently apple does not stand by their product anymore  they wouldn t refund me or even exchange it for a different model  with intel chip   so i spent       on a new computer that literally failed at all the work tasks that i really needed it to do and there is no recourse  not to mention that for       you get   thunderbolt usb c ports  because of this i ended up purchasing a high quality docking station        and still some of the features that i was counting on like the avb network protocol would not work on this m  mac  unless you buy    yes    apple adaptors to use in tandem   sounds like a rip off right  i ve literally spent days and hours on the phone with support from apple  windows  parallels  owc  kensington and at the end of the day the m  mac just isn t compatible with so many things i ve been a staunch apple user and fan for many years  but this experience might just bring me back to microsoft please stay clear of these m  macs and don t count on the apple store to provide you with excellent service  unless you are about to hand them over a few thousand dollars for a new computer that underperforms  for               for docking station and case  i got a bunch of disappointment  stress  frustration  literally the worst purchase i ve ever made regarding the apple store where i made the purchase  they apparently are in the business of taking a customer s money  but not in the business of providing said customer with anything else except a bad product ,US,0.7609,positive
3975,first off i m giving this one star just so you ll read this honest review  i brought this mac book and have been satisfied with functionality and speed but i m giving   star because apple really nickel and dimes us as customers  the usb c cable that comes with the laptop is not even close to being one of the best on the market  i attempted to use it to power my elgato game capture card and the card would not read  kept saying i need a usb    to work  so i then used the cable that came with my samsung external hard drive and bang it work immediately  i spent a lot of money on this laptop just to receive a weak cable with it  the cable is literally only good for charging and light duty file transfer which i guess is ok for most people  but for me it was not  apple already doesn t give us headphones anymore and they don t even have the decency to give us a very good cable   star because for this price i could have built a computer or brought a prebuilt one  last apple laptop i will ever buy  o and the camera sucks and there are no setting to adjust it ,US,0.9317,positive

3988,i just got my new macbook air and was super excited as it is my first ever mac computer  but it will not turn on  hopefully i will be able to return it  but either way it is going to be a hassle  a big reason i bought this was that i was tired of my windows laptop taking forever on windows updates and often being slow  but at least that thing can turn on very disappointed with this i thought one of the big selling points with mac products was that they  just work   when i first opened it after it arrived  it would not turn on  i figured ok  i thought they come with some battery life but i guess i have to charge it  it turned on once after charging it for a bit and then never again  after i went through the initial setup config i closed the laptop to let it finish charging  i came back an hour later and it would not turn on  i have tried charging it  i have tried plugging the charger into a different outlet  i have reseated the usb c cable and tried both ports  i have held down the power button for     seconds  i have tried hitting control   command   power  it doesn t do anything doesn t even make a boot up sound it just won t turn on  looks like i am going back to a windows laptop i have never had one that completely doesn t work at least ,US,0.4448,positive

4002,owned a      macbook air that had display issues from the get go  but apple said it might be okay if i was super careful handling it   i couldn t go without a laptop for   weeks so decided to risk it   after a couple yrs of being super careful the display became distorted after just a slight bump  and after the warranty period of course   used it hooked up to the tv only for about a year  but as that was difficult in itself  overheating  prevented sleep function  etc   had to change course   didn t wanna pay      for a new display  so   bought the m       macbook air instead  seemed to be operating well until   months in  when i wasn t even anywhere near it and the display went totally out   wouldn t turn on after repeated powering down so called apple   they had me power on with that shift control for    secs and it went on again  however  considering my experience with my last laptop took no chances and brought it in to apple they ran diagnostics and found that the ambient light sensor wasn t working   that s what automatically dims and brightens the screen when going into dark or bright places  in case you  like i  didn t really know what it did   had never dropped this or mishandled it in any way sent in my laptop for repair and it s now been more than a week without and they re still  diagnosing  it   luckily my old laptop is still semi functional if i hook it up to my tv   and i still had a few months left in the warranty   but what if it didn t and i didn t have the old one still functional two times in a row macbook air with serious display issues in the last   yrs  with no accidental damage from me  aside from this  has superior speed and processing power  doesn t overheat  but still takes       sec to power up and the touchpad functionality and the feel of both it and the keyboard are terrible when compared to the      i used to have if you buy an apple laptop now apple care plus is almost mandatory   will have to seriously consider going back to windows for my next laptop ,US,0.9599,positive
4003,great out of the box  then slowly the battery life started decreasing  the constant hard reboots to get safari back up and running  inexplicably running hot  and crashing more often than a windows machine  simply plugging in the power adapter is enough to crash the system followed by the necessary reboot i firmly believe that apple will eventually get the bugs will get worked out  but for now look elsewhere or wait for either the m x or m  processors that will hopefully have this operating smoothly update  there are other emerging issues in safari  the keystrokes to italicize  command i  will randomly switch to opening up a new email message  and the keystrokes to convert text to latex   command shift l  now inexplicably opens the left panel  i am also coming into the known compatibility issue mentioned elsewhere ,US,0.6187,positive
4004,bought one directly from apple  i was excited to see how nice it would be to use since i had recently moved over to using an iphone and was impressed at how it had improved over the years  all the positive reviews and videos everywhere made this seem like a great product  don t be fooled  please  this is one of the most disappointing and frustrating pieces of tech i ve ever had the displeasure of getting to use  never have i seen or used a computer that had so many options that you will never need  missing options you should always have  and not be capable of preforming basic tasks without bugging out  to those saying this is one of the best computers you ve ever used  have you ever used a computer before  anytime within the last       years  i m willing to bet not ,US,0.9555,positive

4010,lightweight  blazing fast  easy to use  battery life is incredible with the new apple m  chip   a typical great apple product however  there is only a thunderbolt port  so you now have to go out and buy a cable to convert usb to thunderbolt  if you want to use a backup hard drive  or other usb items  and  i had to buy yet another cable to sync my phone s lightning port to the thunderbolt port on the computer  total     i love apple product  and worked for them in my caerer  but i would wait on buying this version until the software for it has been developed update  after several months of using this computer  i have have found several things of concern     my notification center keeps disappearing  despite my constant reinstalling the widgets     my computer s calendar  reminders  and photo stream do not sync with my ios devices  iphone   ipad    if i add an item to calendar on my phone  it will appear on my mac but not vice versa   reminders will not sync regardless of which device i originate the item on i have contacted apple support on all these issues and they cannot solve the problem it appears that the bugs have not been worked out  yet   things are maddeningly clunky ,US,0.891,positive

4013,buying into the apple ecosystem should only be done to make products for the ecosystem which will make the user money  but  do not make them a critical part of your workflow   they are too expensive for that   apple just does not make good computers   yes  they make a ok operating system  but they make computers that cannot be repaired by taking out the ssd or ram sticks and putting new ones in you can t just go and buy the parts to fix your mac computers when they break   the macbook air is no exception to this   the ssd is solider to the motherboard   likewise the ram   now  if that were the only problem  well    one would be able to get someone skilled to replace these broken pieces after apple stop warranty coverage    maybe   but  they don t even allow the suppliers of these chips to supply them to the public   so  once the warranty is  up    you will not be able to get spare parts for the computer   needless to say  this is a major flaw in apple products    of which it is no exception for this macbook air    oh  and if they start allowing suppliers to supply  but  lock down with crypto keys to a particular machine we just have even more e waste  also  this computer flickers with a  k output   the macbook air has screen flicker with an external monitor using the hootoo dock that i ve used with an intel macbook pro which is a few years old   this is unacceptable   apple s response to the sometimes frying the computer for using usb c docks that work with other computers is an example of the poorly built computer they are pushing though poorly engineered in terms of video  ssd  and ram   it is a wonderful typing experience when using the laptop keyboard   if you are willing to let that guide you  then  the computer may be worth it if you are willing to set aside another grand when ssd fails or you plug in the wrong dock to drive an external monitor even though someone else just had their intel mac plugged in and worked just fine    supposedly apple fix this with an os update    good for them  even though i dislike the mac  it is better than most laptops    because it is quiet since it has no fan   would i buy one again  perhaps    it is a question of whether i think the market exists for me to make money off of it the good things keyboard  touchpad  built in screen  build in speakers  drives external audio better than microsoft windows  and the operating system is less cluttered than is windows   also  comes with a spreadsheet  word processor  presentation program    now  it is better just to use something really libre    like libreoffice   but  it is kind of nice the table steaks are included    unlike for microsoft windows ,US,0.0527,positive
